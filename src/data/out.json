Nevertheless, Warwick For Free Education and the SU sabbs were quick to criticise Dave for his acceptance. Together, they wrote a stern message, condemning Dave for this political act; indeed, his terrible taste in jokes. The only possible response, they agreed, was to no-platform Dave, making future sets at Warwick SU impossible.

The SU has released a statement saying that, by visibly having a \u2018fucking great time\u2019 while singing this song, Creasy, 22, was tacitly supporting a backwards view of the African continent, a view which the SU does not take lightly.</p><p>Any speculation that this culling had been motivated by the power-hunger of another candidate was\u00a0soon dispelled, as both Luke Pilot, the acting welfare officer, and Remington Spa, the populist candidate, were also expelled from the race.</p><p>After a long forensic investigation, the SU determined that the cap Remington Spa is sporting in his campaign videos is in fact from Donald Trump\u2019s \u2018Make America Great Again\u2019 range.

The mood was perfectly captured by India Ferrence, a Computer Science finalist, whose apathy towards the original election week had now turned to sheer resentment, \u201cI guess the SU have finally managed to get students to give more than zero shits about the elections, but that isn\u2019t a good thing\u201d.</p>",

Regardless of my continued failure to deliver, I feel that my tenacity and various other skills honed every other Wednesday lunch time during term time has given me an edge over other candidates.

No, they\u2019re going to want to know that you can write a CV, and fit in line at the desk factory. Why else do we pay \u00a39k a year but for a piece of paper that says \u201cmy upbringing was sufficiently middle class to allow me to blend into the office furniture\u201d. I say our man Terrence doesn\u2019t go far enough \u2014 let\u2019s bulldoze the humanities\u00a0building. Let\u2019s create an entire faculty devoted to career studies. Let\u2019s stop with this pretension that university is about developing your critical, academic, and social faculties. Let\u2019s get a fresh cohort of Career<em>ology</em>, Career Science, and Career Studies undergrads.

Imagine that! Just think what you could gain from forcing\u00a0the bleary eyed and beleaguered post-grad tutor (ending post-grad exploitation being <em>another</em> flash of genius by this academic demigod) put in extra hours to further annotate the egregious essay you shat out in a hungover blur.</p><p>Terrence truly is a rose amongst a bed of weeds. Under Terrence, the future is bright. Now you\u2019ve heard the news, I don\u2019t really know why anyone would decide to vote differently. Terrence for education! Terrence for president!

    "ogimage": "../../public/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/FullSizeRender-3.jpg",
    "body": "<p>A survey of 250 potential voters were asked how many shits, on a scale of 0 to 10, they gave about the outcomes of the upcoming votes for the various positions the SU has to offer. All 250 voters selected 0. Five of the respondents were standing for positions themselves. When asked why they decided to run if they didn\u2019t care, one of them responded, \u201cI needed something to do with my weekends\u201d, while another said, \u201cI thought I was ordering pizza\u201d.</p><p>Among those who are bothering to look into the candidates in any detail out of lack of anything better to do with their time, a few names have proven to be very popular. For example, the populist Remington Spa. He\u2019s a multi-billionaire real estate mogul and TV personality with hair resembling a dead fox, whose plans include building a wall between Warwick University and Mexico and \u201cbeating the hell out of ISIS\u201d, and has been described by many potential voters as \u201chigh energy\u201d.</p><p>The SU hustings did nothing to alleviate the voters\u2019 lack of respect for the system, and some candidates really failed to deliver. Jed Bushman had to ask for applause after giving the response to a question about \u201cboots on the ground\u201d in Coventry, while when Mark O\u2019Rubens was asked a question about the record of current SU lead, Isaac Leigh, he responded, \u201cLet\u2019s dispel with this notion that President Leigh doesn\u2019t know what he\u2019s doing \u2013 he knows exactly what he\u2019s doing!\u201d This did nothing to allay the concerns of the admittedly small audience.</p><p>This extreme electoral apathy does not mean that nobody will vote, however. If that happens, the election starts all over again, and campus will once again be completely covered in cardboard signs with names on them, which for some reason the candidates appear to think is a valuable campaigning tactic. This has led to the strange situation where even some of the most disillusioned voters are going to submit ballots, even if they do this by throwing darts at their computer monitor.</p><p>This poll comes amid the electoral fraud controversy surrounding the candidate known as RON, who appears to have been nominated for every single SU position. He is running on the unusual platform that any position he wins will be re-elected immediately.

She was assigned a five page essay comparing and contrasting two different books and was given three weeks to write it. Sounds pretty tough, right? Jane upped the stakes! She wrote the entire thing from 4am to 7:59am without reading either book and managed to get a B+. Wow! That\u2019s really impressive \u2014 given the time constraint and how tired she must have been, at least.</p><h3>2.

Most people would study for each test separately a few days prior, but that just wasn\u2019t gonna cut it for Larry. With an hour between each test, he decided to do all his preparation in the time between each test. And guess what? He managed to average a B- across all three tests! Remarkable \u2014 well, I mean, since he learned it all on the day.</p><h3>3.

Each student saves their colouring sheets from the year in a big binder to be put on display at Open House. Simple enough, right? Natalie took it to the next level! Having not done a single colouring sheet the entire year, she coloured them all completely blue 15 minutes before it was due and got three gold stars.

Copper Rooms bars, even on a desolate night, are vicious and competitive places. The tall, as ever, receive preferential treatment. Bar persons prioritise their friends and acquaintances.</p><p>We find ourselves on tiptoes, leaning dangerously across the bar and brandishing a tenner in our fingertips.\u00a0Prices are high.

Then Thrift\u00a0commanded the body to be delivered.\u00a0And when George Lawlor\u00a0had taken the body, he wrapped it in a clean linen cloth,\u00a0And laid it in his own new tomb, which he had hewn out in the rock: and he rolled a great stone to the door of the sepulchre, and departed.\u201d</p>",

Whether it is the high-pressure Midlands environment, or the string of well-to-do facility abusers wandering through the bed-not-board halls of this young institution, an unforgivable\u00a0number of Hall sub-compartments have sought to take the great step into the final unknown.</p><p>Details are still hazy, but just yesterday campus avoided another such near miss.

The Library has recently suffered from excessive consumer demands, including 24 hour opening times, and somewhere to sit; this has caused untold damage to its esteemed reputation, and has limited its future growth forecasts.

Libel, and for that matter illegality, is a path we are wary of treading. As such, we\u2019ve put together an endearing collection of our favourite line-crossers.</p><p>If any of you happen to be Isaac Leigh, Luke Pilot, or George Creasy, and find these harmless untruths disquieting, we\u2019ll reluctantly redact, and think less of you for it.</p><h4>1. Isaac Leigh \u2018recovering well\u2019 after realising he has to enter the real world</h4><h5>Isaac Leigh, amateur blogger and\u00a0occasional\u00a0SU President, is reportedly on the mend\u00a0after the shock discovery he cannot remain at Warwick indefinitely.</h5><p>Isaac Leigh\u2019s realisation that he has to exit the veritable womb of Warwick into the world of real employment is said to have come as a surprise to Disco Dave\u2019s quixotic\u00a0paymaster.</p><p>After whiling away an entire year getting righteously indignant about the blasted buses, and waving a tearful goodbye to his chum Nigel Thrift \u2014 the recent elections mean that Isaac Leigh will have to end his self-imposed imprisonment on campus and explore the world outside Warwickshire.</p><p>Such a move is rendered necessary by the election of the man ranked by\u00a0<em>The Tab\u00a0</em>\u00a0as\u00a0\u2018Most Insipid on Campus\u2019 \u2014 Luke\u00a0\u2018Peter Pan\u2019\u00a0Pilot. Pilot won himself yet another year gathering dust in the sprawling Byzantine behemoth that is the SU, bankrolled by the vampiric SU charges levied on actual students here. Pilot\u2019s ticket was largely a promise to reject the strictures of time and \u00a0to\u00a0remain a child forever.</p><p>Isaac Leigh, according to sources inside the Union, wished to run for a second term as President \u2014 but realised the futility of such a campaign given the failure of his name to provide adequate scope for any piss-poor election wordplay.</p><p>Leigh is said to be willing to accept his fate \u2014 and is currently considering whoring out his mind and soul to \u201cliterally anyone who will take me\u201d. Several top investment banks are reportedly hugely interested in transforming Leigh\u2019s\u00a0body into a vacuous husk in return for a six-figure salary.</p><h4>2.\u00a0SU-wide panic as Warwick \u2018DrugSoc\u2019 shoots up in popularity</h4><h5>Ten students were stopped last year from starting a drug-based society.</h5><p>Last week, in what he called his last \u2018Fuck you\u2019 to the Student Union, George Creasy approved the shady sect, saying \u201cWell if I lose to a guy with a shit hat for a campaign, why don\u2019t we just let everything go up in flames?:\u201d (Creasy has since stated that he meant this purely figuratively, and has nothing to do with any fires that may have recently occurred.) (obviously, he hasn\u2019t done or said any of this \u2014ed)</p><p>Since that point, the society has gone nowhere but up, with 6% of students saying they go to meetings \u2018almost daily\u2019. While DrugSoc claims the name is just a playful title, the clouds of dank smoke that hang above the group\u2019s weekly circling event suggest otherwise.</p><p>\u201cYeah, we\u2019re so glad that it\u2019s finally off the ground,\u201d said a founding member of the society, as his pupils broke the pornography industry\u2019s long-standing record for largest gaping hole.</p><p>Meanwhile, the SU\u2019s outrage at Creasy\u2019s careless yet laddish behaviour has been vocal. \u201c6% is ridiculous,\u201d says Rachel Triggert, the LGBTUAXJKE+ officer. \u201c6%, like, that\u2019s almost 10%! How can we stand by and let this happen?\u201d Current action plans include taking to the internet, writing a\u00a0<em>Boar</em>\u00a0article, and giving alienating looks to the evil perpetrators.</p><p>It is still yet to be seen how much damage Creasy has done; in his crack-addled society approval binge, he also approved the suspiciously-named \u2018ISIW\u2019, the ambitious \u2018Warwick Lap Dancing\u2019 and the surprisingly popular \u2018Warwick Casual Sex Society\u2019.</p><h4>3.\u00a0Isaac Leigh: Coming to Murder Your Nan?</h4><p>Isaac Leigh, self-styled supremo of the shady cross-campus conglomerate known only as the \u2018Students Union\u2019, is a well-known name. He gives speeches, makes appearances at events, and harangues you through emails, whose reading list \u2014 try as you might \u2014 you can never fully extricate yourself from.</p><p>But this reporter believes there is something more sinister behind the trained smiles, and media-wide veneer. It has come to this reporters attention that, despite having ample opportunity, Isaac Leigh has never openly denied having a concerted policy of trying to murder your Nan. Don\u2019t believe me? Look through the transcripts \u2014 I invite you. You\u2019ll find, as I did, that in none of the many speeches, campaign rallies, or discarded crosswords in bins that Isaac Leigh has given, there is not a single word to refute this charge.</p><p>This reporter is not trying to claim that Isaac Leigh is spending every waking moment quivering at the prospect of bringing an untimely end to your Nan, nor am I claiming that his office is rammed to the rafters with documents detailing elaborate and gruesome methods by which to carry out his sick fascination. I am merely asking the question of Isaac Leigh \u2013 \u2018Why haven\u2019t you denied it?\u2019 If Isaac Leigh really does not have a platform of coming to murder your Nan \u2014 then why has he never denied this charge?</p><p>In essence there are two possibilities \u2014 either Isaac Leigh is, this very moment, oiling the rifle and preparing the chamber for the bullet that will finish your Nan, salivating at the very prospect of this unprovoked act of malice and depravity \u2014 or he isn\u2019t. It is up to you \u2014 the discerning reader \u2014 to decide which the truth is. So before you jaunt off to your next lecture \u2014 pause for a moment and ask \u2018Is Isaac Leigh coming to murder my Nan?</p><h4></h4>",

However, such criticisms are all too easy to levy when you have an essay due, a healthy allowance, and nothing real to fight for.

For starters, a lot of them aren\u2019t all too bright, usually that wouldn\u2019t be a problem, but when you\u2019re campaigning for the student body, coherence of thought is a good start. Claims in circle-jerk coffee rooms to the flavour of \u201cI\u2019ve got it\u2026 under capitalism\u2026 you just can\u2019t\u2026 like\u2026 have democracy\u201d. Though let us not allow a lack of grey matter have us question their good spirit. What might be a more pertinent criticism would be their disposition to tie \u2018free education\u2019 necessarily to nationalisation and, more broadly, socialism. Often alienated are cost-benefit liberals, and one-nation Conservatives who would oppose tuition fees on different grounds, though find themselves excluded by their repugnance at being handed \u2018The Socialist Worker\u2019 (is that the name of their paper? I can never remember) for fear of the contingent link between the collectivisation of resources and the rise of authoritarianism.</p><blockquote class=\"aligncenter\"><p>Firstly, \u2018they don\u2019t represent us\u2019.

And if you don\u2019t, fine, it\u2019s not my intention to challenge your belief. However, if you vigorously disagree, rather than harmlessly shit on their intentions; then rise from your sedentary backside, engage them in debate, and actively support the status quo. To let it all pass by with unrelenting indifference is tantamount to letting your view be ignored. Moreover, for the half-arsed posts of resentment typically present, one may even posit that they stem from a vehement lack of a decent cause in the life of the author, indeed, a pang of jealousy stemming from a deficiency of community and comradeship.</p><p>Another phlegmatic cop out from meaningful engagement is the argument that their quixotic activities are just that \u2014 futile. That blockades, occupation, and divestment will never achieve any more than a slightly pissed off student body\u2026 an uncooperative grumbling majority. Permit me a contradiction: they\u00a0<em>are</em> effective. We even have an example on our beloved campus. You know the students union buildings? Those things in the centre\u00a0of\u00a0campus, with the big SU sign, the radio recording centre, the copper rooms, a series of over-priced tasteless outlets etc etc? You know the ones? Well they didn\u2019t come with the university. Lord Butterworth\u2019s decree was that Warwick university shall never have a student\u2019s union building, the focus should be upon work alone. Though, following a prolonged occupation, the university authorities eventually caved into allowing a physical manifestation for student representation. Quite something, eh?

    "body": "<p>A lot of people go on about\u00a0how wonderful their year abroad was. It gave them\u00a0the chance to explore a new culture, improve their\u00a0language skills, travel and see a new part of the world. They often also tell you all about the downsides, of how much they missed home, how much of money Dad had to lend them, and how fed up they are of fourth year now all their friends have graduated.</p><p>This kind of humble-brag only drags on the painful torture of listening to how great their lives are and what brilliant opportunities they\u2019ve been given. That is not the case for everyone. For those of you considering a trip out, or who are sick of hearing the same old year abroad stories \u2014 here\u2019s a fistful of Erasmus truth for you.</p><p>Costs racking up on the year abroad? I\u2019m not going to lie, your year abroad comes really cheap. Thanks to everybody\u2019s favourite international trading partner, the EU, I got given loads of cash for the privilege of \u201cstudying\u201d at somebody else\u2019s university for a year. Even those out of the EU still get student loan and are often subject to bursaries and reimbursements.</p><p>A top tip I would recommend is to make the decision to go to a lovely post-communist state which is yet to make its fateful transition to the Euro, making accommodation an absolute steal. Mine was \u00a3110 a month. I just tried not to think about how little that cleaner must have got paid and learnt to ignore the ex-soviet caretaker who was overly fond of turning the lights out and shining torches into our faces during prohibited flat parties.</p><p>Surely you missed home? Luckily enough my family is absolutely shit, we barely talk to each other, and give each other little to no support, so I had no problem buggering off away from them for a year. If your family gets on your tits, use your year abroad to escape. You can probably even get out of phone calls too if you don\u2019t show your Mum how to call on WhatsApp. Not only did my year abroad give me the chance to spend time away from them, it also meant I could show them I didn\u2019t need their financial or emotional support in anyway. In no way. So there. Not that they would have given it to me anyway.</p><p>Weren\u2019t you worried about missing final year with your friends? Don\u2019t need them anyway. Realistically you\u2019re stuck with the people you happened to be put next door to in halls and those you got huddled together with in your first core seminar. Now you\u2019ve found yourself awkwardly attached and with little chance of breaking free. Use the year abroad to your advantage. The further you go the less likely they are to visit you.</p><p>But how good are your language skills now? Don\u2019t be too hasty. I couldn\u2019t speak the language of the country that I went to, I learnt the bare minimum when I was there, and actually found my English got worse. Erasmus-speak \u2014 reducing your grammar and vocab to that of the texts you sent when you were thirteen \u2014 is definitely a real issue. I even found myself pretending not to speak English if I couldn\u2019t be arsed with broken Euro-chat.</p><p>But what about opening your eyes to new experiences? I got put in halls with other English students and made friends with them. We stuck together, drank Carling and shopped in M&S. What\u2019s the point of faking some commonality with students from other countries? Much easier to stick to what you know.</p><p>Surely you learned something? None of the work counted towards my degree. I missed as many classes I could get away with and received firsts in all my assignments because my English was better than that of the lecturers. It was so nice to be able to not listen to intelligent Warwick professors for a while. Seriously, those guys need to give it a break with all their knowledge. <em>Maybe</em> I picked up some cultural and historical info about where I was living, but honestly, I tried really really hard not to.</p><p>So that\u2019s it. Go abroad, escape overpriced British accommodation and the way you actually learn about interesting things with people you like at your British university, and sack it all off for a year avoiding your family and dossing about insulting people and neglecting to recognise your privilege somewhere else instead.</p>",

The events of last spring play on Bunty\u2019s mind often: \u201cawful. Just awful\u2026 we tried to get in. Just to see what was going on in there, you know? There was no space anywhere else in the library, and we could see a couple of free chairs through the glass wall. We waited for someone to come along. Eventually a little Economics PhD student came along. We followed. My god\u2026 the spare seats. Hundreds of them. Thousands. 1% of students hoarding 99% of desk space. And to do what? Research? Fuck off.</p><p>\u201cIn the end we were dragged out by the police. They came in with those little paper cones they have by the water tanks. When they were done throwing unsatisfying amounts of liquid at us, they just started stabbing us with the pointy bits. Took one to the eye. It hurt a lot.

We\u2019ve carefully assembled, with the help of a fully accredited professional in an unrelated field, a list of ten less illegal ways to get one over on your food-prep\u00a0foe.</p><h2>1. Shit in a cupboard.</h2><p>Did you hear the Rootes story last year? Campus was alight with one question: \u2018who shat in the cupboard?\u2019 This is an excellent way to simultaneously irritate everyone on your floor and draw attention to your struggle.</p><h2>2. Punch holes in their condoms (or their significant other\u2019s condoms).</h2><p>No one wants an unwanted pregnancy. Literally never. It\u2019ll only take a pin, 10 minutes and an intensive search of your victim\u2019s room to wreak\u00a0life-changing damage. Perfect!</p><h2>3. Steal their phone and send emails saying\u00a0\u2018i want to fuck you, bus stop @22:30\u2019 to their personal tutor.</h2><p>Personal tutors normally get in on the joke quickly, and agree to\u00a0a spot of hanky-panky in the car park stairwell opposite the sports centre.</p><div class=\"_5wd4 _1nc7 _5ysy direction_ltr\"><div class=\"_5wd9\"><div class=\"_5wde _n4o\"><div class=\"_5w1r _3_om _5wdf\"><div class=\"_4gx_\"><h2 class=\"_d97\"><span class=\"_5yl5\">4. Lie to them that no one wants to pay their ransom.</span></h2><p>People are always getting kidnapped at Warwick \u2014 that sort of thing happens when you\u2019re so far from the South East. Telling your flatmate that they\u2019d probably be left to rot in the boot of a Vauxhall Corsa the next time they get\u00a0taken hostage will seriously spook them out.</p></div></div></div></div><h2 class=\"_3ry4\">5. Make a bitchy WhatsApp group and exclude them from it.</h2><p class=\"_3ry4\">If you hadn\u2019t heard, WhatsApp got encrypted \u2014 sad because now Obama can\u2019t read your conversations with\u00a0mum. The good news is that it makes your exclusionary group chats even more exclusionary. Drop hints of its existence by erupting into laughter, then staring\u00a0at your adversary awkwardly.</p><h2 class=\"_3ry4\">6. Build a vast pyre of toast and set fire to it at an unsociable hour in the morning.</h2><p class=\"_3ry4\">Fire alarm! Such fun.</p><h2 class=\"_3ry4\">7. Stop tagging them in \u2018Tag someone who\u2026\u2019 \u00a0Facebook posts.</h2><p class=\"_3ry4\">You can\u2019t better the bants of \u2018tag someone\u00a0who hasn\u2019t had sex in 2016\u2019, \u2018tag a mate\u00a0who looks like a rapist\u2019 or \u2018tag two friends who were previously engaged in trench warfare but were forced to stop by a UN peacekeeping force in the summer of 2003\u2019!\u00a0Everybody\u00a0freaks out when their friends stop pass-agg tagging them in these things.</p><h2 class=\"_3ry4\">8. Propose marriage.</h2><p class=\"_3ry4\">Having to turn down unwanted betrothals is <em>so</em> embarrassing.\u00a0Your opponent will abhor the experience so much, he or she might just say yes. Then you\u2019ll both have to endure several years of living hell!</p></div><div class=\"_5wd4 _1nc7 _5ysy direction_ltr\"><div class=\"_5wd9\"><div class=\"_5wde _n4o\"><div class=\"_5w1r _3_om _5wdf\"><div class=\"_4gx_\"><h2 class=\"_d97\"><span class=\"_5yl5\">9. Piss on them, unless they\u2019re on fire.</span></h2><p>Faeces, vomit and bodily fluids are always the best way to end an argument, just don\u2019t extinguish your\u00a0rival\u2019s\u00a0burning body!</p></div></div></div></div></div><h2>10. Write non-racist things\u00a0on their bananas.</h2><p>\u2018You\u2019re silly!\u2019 \u2018I don\u2019t like you!\u2019 \u2018You\u2019re a pain to share a kitchen with!\u2019 Nearly all phrases aren\u2019t technically hate crimes.

But, as we well know,\u00a0it\u2019s never too late to claw back a 2:1.</p><p>With this in mind, you should definitely continue to waste your time by reading this list of handy revision tips that will guarantee absolute success.</p><h3>1. Start thinking about starting revision early.</h3><p><em>Early.</em></p><h3>2. Spend ages decorating your notes</h3><p>\u2026with whatever comes to hand: Sharpies, washi tape, a bit of hoof. What your notes lack in content they will make up for in style. Fashion your pages into a tent and crawl in. Write the names of all the seminar tutors and/or lecturers you wanted to fuck on the inside of it. Make your notes into pure art.</p><p></p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-827\" src=\"https://thehoar.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/pug.png\" alt=\"pug\" width=\"960\" height=\"316\" srcset=\"https://thehoar.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/pug.png 960w,https://thehoar.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/pug-300x99.png 300w,https://thehoar.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/pug-768x253.png 768w,https://thehoar.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/pug-192x63.png 192w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px\"><h3>3. Stick revision notes up everywhere, even on your dog.</h3><p>Put so many sticky notes on your pooch that he begins to resemble a colourful pi\u00f1ata. Remember to not thwack him.</p><h3>4. Don\u2019t waste time getting undressed for the shower.</h3><p>Keep wearing the same outfit for weeks on end until it becomes grafted onto your skin. Not only will this save time and leave more for studying, but at the end of the exam season you can rip off your clothes in one fell swoop. You then have yourself the added bonus of a free chemical peel and the treat of watching your now baby-soft skin grow back.</p><h3>5. Much like cooking instructions, chemical equations in textbooks are merely guidelines.</h3><p>Listen to your internal body clock and follow your instincts to the right answer.</p><h3>6. Take a break.</h3><p>But also take a break from having a break, but you can break again soon and take a break from having taken a break from a break.</p><h3>7. If you\u2019ve been revising for hours and nothing else is going in, try trepanning.</h3><p>Roll your notes up into little scrolls and insert them through the circular hole in your skull.</p><h3><img class=\"size-full wp-image-828 alignnone\" src=\"https://thehoar.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/trepanning.png\" alt=\"trepanning\" width=\"960\" height=\"368\" srcset=\"https://thehoar.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/trepanning.png 960w,https://thehoar.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/trepanning-300x115.png 300w,https://thehoar.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/trepanning-768x294.png 768w,https://thehoar.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/trepanning-192x74.png 192w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px\">8. Finally allow yourself to eat white bread.</h3><p>This is no time for fibre.</p><h3>9. Find a work/life balance by starting procrastination before 10am.</h3><p>Fill your day with a static restlessness as you push back any real work until 6pm. Make time for your friends in the evening by arriving an hour before the gig finishes. Everyone has already given their updates so you\u2019re just left to stand in silence without a chair at the back.</p><h3>10.\u00a0Snack heavily.</h3><p>Give up on your aspiration to become an emaciated and nocturnal scholarly type. You will not be able to forgo sleep and sustenance for the pursuit of knowledge. Accept you will get fat.</p><h3>11.\u00a0Kiss your loved ones goodbye.</h3><p>But if you\u2019ve been revising properly you won\u2019t have anyone left to kiss before your final exam.</p><h3>12. Revise in your bed.</h3><p>Sure you have the will power to refrain from napping and touching yourself.</p><h3>13. Exercise.</h3><p>Run away from your problems.</p><p></p><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-829 size-full\" src=\"https://thehoar.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/desk.png\" alt=\"desk\" width=\"960\" height=\"363\" srcset=\"https://thehoar.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/desk.png 960w,https://thehoar.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/desk-300x113.png 300w,https://thehoar.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/desk-768x290.png 768w,https://thehoar.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/desk-192x73.png 192w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px\"><h3>14.\u00a0Get a friend or family member to test you.</h3><p>Have them block the doorway and say they\u2019ll only let you through if you say the magic words.

A protracted shit, in one of the nicer <a href=\"https://thehoar.org/2016/02/15/in-search-of-the-ultimate-warwick-two/\">Wonka factories</a>, could eat another quarter of an hour. But what of the remaining ninety mins?</p><p>With no opponents, no venue and no team-mates, a game of football is out of the question. The university stubbornly refuses to provide sewing machines in the Learning Grid, so <a href=\"http://www.simplesimonandco.com/2013/09/the-90-minute-dress-tutorial.html\">making a dress</a> is practically impossible in so short a window. The only option is to work; to work in the library.</p><p>A problem: it is impossible to <a href=\"https://thehoar.org/2016/03/06/ode-to-an-empty-library-seat/\">find a library seat at midday</a> without devoting at least half an hour to finding it. Half an hour of your time, you are aware, is of too great a value to fritter away\u00a0looking for a desk. Instead, you must arrive at the crack of dawn and \u2014 in\u00a0allusion to the apocryphal German poolside sunbather \u2014\u00a0claim your square metre of prime library escritoire.</p><p>Secured for the full eight hours of your daily campus residency, that table is you dormant home from home \u2014 your empty\u00a0ch\u00e2teau\u00a0in France, your second house lying fallow \u2014 for that two hour break. Here\u2019s how to get one.</p><p></p><img class=\"alignleft size-post-thumbnail wp-image-837\" src=\"https://thehoar.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/FullSizeRender-960x448.png\" alt=\"FullSizeRender\" width=\"960\" height=\"448\" srcset=\"https://thehoar.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/FullSizeRender.png 960w,https://thehoar.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/FullSizeRender-300x140.png 300w,https://thehoar.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/FullSizeRender-768x358.png 768w,https://thehoar.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/FullSizeRender-192x90.png 192w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px\"><h3>1. Choose a convenient seat</h3><p>The sort that someone else is likely to covet. It must have a socket, even if you have no laptop. It must be by a window. It must not be opposite a deranged fidgety specimen. You may only plan to sit there for 25 minutes, but your comfort is paramount.</p><h3>2. Cover it with library books that you have no intention of reading</h3><p>Books are your protection from invaders. A book on your desk implies that your absence is temporary. A book is\u00a0un-stealable: the shelves are littered with equivalent models, and you own none of them so who cares? Should somebody require one of your protection books, screw \u2018em.</p><h3>3. Have a phone conversation</h3><p>You may not need to. You may not want to. But why not?</p><h3>4. Leave</h3><p>You have a lecture to go to. You are more important than the other, present, library-goers. Fourth floor is supposed to be\u00a0a sea of empty\u00a0chairs.</p><h3>5. Return</h3><p>Rules are for losers, and you have a box of sardine pasta and a packet of crisps that you\u2019re bloody well going to eat. You\u2019ve bought a coffee too, which you\u2019re going to spill because you\u2019re great.</p><h3>6. Browse Facebook</h3><p>Go to town. Browse more intensely than ever you would at home. See a nice picture? Tame your shrew. Make it aggressively clear that have no intention of doing anything of value. You own that seat because you deserve it, not because you need it.</p><h3>7. Put all of the things in your bag onto your desk, and other desks near you</h3><p>Six months\u2019 dirty tissues. A vibrator. Some broken pens. Many more books. Pile \u2018em up and let \u2018em spill.</p><h3>8. Develop an infectious-sounding illness</h3><p>Ideally, you should be sneezing, have bloodshot eyes, some kind of rash and a loudly mucus-filled nose. Everybody within a five metre radius of you should be afraid for their health.</p><h3>9. Set your phone to vibrate, unmute every group chat and place it on a hard surface</h3><p>You are intensely popular. Everyone must know.</p><h3>10. Take extremely regular lavatorial breaks (the\u00a0infectious-sounding illness might come in handy)</h3><p>Keep the others on their toes by taking a ten-minute break every five minutes. If male, be sure to spend at least half that time standing a metre from the urinal. Other chaps have no right to see you tickle\u00a0your Twix, but let\u2019s treat them.</p><h3>11. Purchase more food</h3><p>Obviously, you aren\u2019t hungry, but it\u2019s never the wrong time to smear\u00a0half a tuna mayo sandwich into your desk. Try to work it into the corners.</p><h3>12. Take off your shoes</h3><p>They <em>are</em> uncomfortable. Largely because you\u2019re shit at buying shoes. Take off the rest of your clothing too. The library is far too hot. What kind of prick is going to object to your bald man in a boat?</p><h3>13.\u00a0Have an enthusiastic conversation in a foreign language</h3><p>If English is your only tongue, make grunting noises instead.</p><h3>14. Leave again</h3><p>It\u2019s important not to forget that you are more important than the other library-goers. Leave everything valueless \u2014 or owned by someone else \u2014 in its place on the desk.</p><h3>15. Return seven hours later, simply to retrieve your jacket and textbooks</h3><p>Keep your options open, and own that space even when you are certain you have no further opportunity to use it.</p><h3>16. Leave your litter in a small pile in the corner of the desk</h3><p>It helps the cleaners.</p><h3>17. When leaving, make sure you are level with the barrier card scanners before making any attempt to locate your student card</h3><p>Maybe try using your bank card first. The people queuing behind you love the theatricality of this process. They worship you.</p><h3>18. Have another enthusiastic conversation in a foreign language directly in front of the barriers</h3><p>It\u2019s the most convenient place for you to catch your friends \u2014 they have to push past you to enter or leave the library. Perfect!</p><h3>19.\u00a0Fuck off and learn to share common space</h3><p>Enough said.</p>",

It was organised by the Warwick Anglo-Saxon society, who quite rightly are concerned with the continued oppression of their race and the deeply rooted anti-Saxon prejudice that still pervades society.</p><p>But after the event took place, a group of Viking men were apparently verbally abused. According to one of the victims, a Saxon group who had been attending the event started yelling slurs, such as \u2018Danskj\u00e4vlar\u2019, \u2018damn Nordeners\u2019, and perhaps most insultingly \u2018fjord huggers\u2019.</p><p>Witnesses claim that the attackers also mocked the Vikings\u2019 accents by shouting \u2018holdy boldy barbecue\u2019, describing it as \u2018very racist, but surprisingly accurate\u2019. The Vikings were apparently very halberd-ed by the experience, which sources tell us is their equivalent of being triggered.</p><p>Some were not as sympathetic to the plight of the victims. One passer-by told us, \u201cThey can\u2019t have been assaulted. To assault someone you need power and privilege, which these Saxons simply don\u2019t have at this university!\u201d Another student wore a #killallvikings shirt, and flatly refused to be approached for comment.</p><p>The event was off to a shaky start, when a group of annoyed history students pointed out to the organisers that the Nordic assault on the North of England was more characteristic of an invasion than colonisation. They disrupted the proceedings at the beginning, but calmed down when they realised that the coffee shops around campus had started to open. This minor distraction aside, tickets and privileges were checked and the day was ready to begin.</p><p>The main focus of the day were the WOKEshops, where awake people participated in groups discussing subjects as broad as making students safer by preventing Vikings carrying their axes everywhere, how the statue of King Knut is sexist and should be taken down, and how the horniness of their helmets contribute to rape culture on campus. Apparently there were also SLEEPshops, but their debate was reported to be less lively.</p><hr><h1>2.\u00a0Ramble: can we award more thirds to idiots?</h1><p></p><img class=\"alignleft size-post-thumbnail wp-image-1374\" src=\"https://thehoar.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/tb1990-960x593.jpg\" alt=\"tb1990\" width=\"960\" height=\"593\"><h2>It\u2019s alright, I get it. You want a job at the end of your degree.</h2><p>Well, I\u2019ll let you in on a secret; so does everybody else. The idea that you need a first to get one is silly. The idea that if we award everyone a first then we\u2019ll all end up with jobs is even sillier.</p><p>Walk into the library on any day of the week and have a wander. I guarantee you\u2019ll spot plenty of people sitting scrolling through <em>insert generic social network</em>, or having a natter, or staring at a blank document with a title and a flashing cursor. It could hardly be called \u2018working,\u2019 could it? Yet I\u2019m also confident that if you ask any of those people what degree classification they think they\u2019ll get, you won\u2019t get an answer anything lower than a 2:1. And I\u2019m fairly sure we\u2019d find similar situations in pretty much every university in the UK. (Except perhaps Coventry \u2014 the sheer effort of vocalising their thoughts is simply too much for one of these students, and would simply leave them a dribbling wreck for the rest of the day.)</p><p>We are a generation of individuals with one colossal self-entitlement complex. As soon as we are given a task where independent learning or genuine thought is required, we are reduced to quivering wrecks. People talk about exams being \u2018too difficult\u2019, or assignment questions being \u2018too vague\u2019. Bollocks. Exams should be hard. Assignments should be challenging. Your tutor should be able to tell you you\u2019re spouting gibberish. University should be tough.</p><p>I\u2019ll admit, the problem runs through the system. Back at GCSE and A-Level, no thought was ever really required: rote-learn the content, play the mark scheme, and out would come an A on that nice results day sheet. University should be the place where that changes. Ideally, if you\u2019re thick, this should be bad news: you\u2019ll still come out with a degree, but it will only be a 2:2 or a third. However, for the more gifted (yes, contrary to what your primary school teacher had you believe, some people are in fact more clever than others) this is great. Work hard, and away you walk with a 2:1 or a first. The problem is, this is no longer happening. We are blindly walking into a world where everyone achieves, and no-one significantly more than anyone else. To quote the Tory MP, Jacob Reese-Mogg, completely out of context: \u2018I\u2019m not a fan of this new age drippiness\u2019.</p><p>I like to think I\u2019m fairly intelligent. More intelligent than some of my course mates? Yeah, I\u2019d say so. So rightfully, I\u2019d like a better degree classification than them. And I\u2019d like Warwick to acknowledge my intellectual superiority by awarding these lower achievers lower degree classifications, so my eventual 2:1 or first is more noteworthy.</p><p>The truth is, I\u2019m a bit useless at lots of other things. In terms of the genetic lottery, about the only thing I won was a brain that\u2019s reasonably good at retaining information for exams. On the football pitch at school I would never be man of the match (or whatever it\u2019s called) because I have all the coordination of a drunken three-legged baboon. And I was alright with this, because I knew that when it came to the end of year tests I\u2019d thump the chaps who repeatedly thumped me at football, or rugby, or cricket, or whatever the game being played was. There\u2019s a sense of justice in that.</p><p>I could go on with these incoherent ramblings, but I think that by this point you\u2019ve got the gist of what I\u2019m saying. (Assuming you\u2019re not a rugby player, in which case you gave up on the whole \u2018reading\u2019 thing long before you got to my paragraph about your beloved sport.) In brief, can we please award more thirds to thick people? That would be great.</p><p>[Append your own conclusion \u2014 our contributor must have been desperate for a shit or something, because this article ended fast.

This may seem benign but, nevertheless, all it does is reinforce a drinking culture that perpetuates patriarchal norms (including rape culture) and colonial legacies.\u201d</p><p>Intrigued particularly by his citation colonial influences, our reporters continued\u00a0questioning the Warwick Anti-Downing Society Chair whilst our fact-checkers continued to neglect their clearly unimportant coursework and exam revision in light of\u00a0their newfound quest to find the aforementioned \u201cliterature\u201d on \u2018downing\u2019.</p><p>\u201cThis one time, I saw a Black student \u2013 or maybe he was\u00a0Chinese or Indian or something \u2014 successfully \u2018downing\u2019 a drink when prompted to by largely cis white hetero male peers. This was clearly a way of disciplining him/her/it into historical colonial power structures because, obviously, when white people interact with black people, they\u2019re only looking to reinforce imperialist mindsets even if they claim that they are friends. Sorry, I called the victim black, he/she/it may have also been Chinese, Indian or Irish. You can never tell because colonialist legacies are just so widespread and rampant. Fortunately, I\u2019m largely immune to the mindset by which people \u2018Other\u2019 others. Oh? You don\u2019t know what \u2018Othering\u2019 is? There\u2019s loads of literature on it \u2014 seriously just take a look. It\u2019s not all your fault for being so insensitive and oppressive though,\u00a0we seriously need a liberated curriculum that isn\u2019t just filled with white males who \u2018down\u2019 alcoholic beverages.\u201d</p><p>Whilst our reporters\u00a0felt extremely guilty at their shameful, oppressive, and destructive ignorance, they mustered up the courage to ask the seemingly all-knowing Warwick Anti-Downing Society Chair about the\u00a0previous contention that the norm of \u2018downing\u2019 drinks actually perpetuates \u201crape culture\u201d. At this, he pointed us in the general direction of the Men\u2019s Rugby team, whom we then quizzed.</p><p>We interviewed\u00a0a Rugby player who would only refer to himself as \u2018Shlid\u2019. When asked about this, the self-proclaimed Shlid explained that \u201cthe lads say I have a shit lid so they call me Shlid.\u201d Satisfied with his thorough answer, we proceeded to ask him about the links between \u2018downing\u2019 drinks and \u2018rape culture\u2019.</p><p>\u201cWell, this one time, we went on the lash the night before a game with Loughborough Men\u2019s and we got absolutely raped the next day.\u201d Shlid eloquently told us. At that moment, it became clear to us that drinking\u2019s role in perpetuating rape culture may not just be confined to Warwick, but may also involve Loughborough. As the story began to unravel before us, our Editor suggested that we set up a network of investigative journalists across the world but we decided against it because we did not want to detract from the importance of the Panama Papers (for the moment).</p><p>When we pressed Shlid\u00a0further on whether \u201cgoing on the lash\u201d often\u00a0involves \u2018downing\u2019 the drinks, he responded\u00a0\u201cCan\u2019t remember, mate.\u201d Not satisfied with his cryptic response, our reporters proceeded to ask him whether he had ever been called a \u201cgayboy\u201d for not adequately downing a drink when prompted to by his peers. Shlid\u00a0promptly responded, \u201cNo, that would be tight. I\u2019m not gay, I\u2019ve only got a shit lid.\u201d</p><p>Upon returning to the Warwick Anti-Downing Society Chair, we we planned to inform him/her/it of the irrefutable, startling evidence we had unearthed. However, the Chair had other plans and told us of new alliances he had made. \u201cI\u2019m actually in talks with Warwick For Free Education to hold a demo to disrupt buses across the country because drinking is such an integral\u00a0part of Higher Education and \u2018downing\u2019 drinks is\u00a0actually a considerable\u00a0strain on students\u2019 budgets\u00a0so now WADS is working on smashing capitalism alongside WFFE \u2014 one bus service disruption at a time.\u201d</p><p>Absolutely amazed by the astounding conviction of the Chair, we asked whether there were plans for any more alliances now that Warwick Anti-Downing Society was on a mission to destroy patriarchy, capitalism, and colonialism all at once. \u201cYes,\u201d he/she/it responded, \u201cI\u2019m in contact with the British Pagan Council because I believe that \u2018downing\u2019 drinks is actually a cultural appropriation\u00a0since it was witches, shamans, and druids who\u00a0adopted the practice to feel at one with Nature. We clearly have no right to culturally appropriate from already marginalised communities \u2013 I mean,\u00a0we\u2019re living in the 21st century and the Witchcraft Act of 1735 outlawed punishing people from practicing witchcraft and here we are just downing drinks and not acknowledging the fact that we burnt all those poor witches without even offering\u00a0reparations.\u201d</p><p>At press time, the British Pagan Council, Warwick For Free Education, Warwick Anti-Sexism Society and Warwick Anti-Racism Society were not called for comment, mainly because our reporters had grown tired of the story as I\u2019m sure any reader that\u2019s made it this far probably has. Nevertheless, our Editor insisted that as we ask the Warwick Anti-Downing Society Chair about why he/she/it does not just simply swap alcoholic beverages for non-alcoholic beverages.</p><p>The Warwick Anti-Downing Society Chair immediately stuck his/her/its middle finger up at us whilst proclaiming that we were all cis white hetero male, colonialist, imperialist, culturally appropriating, racist, rapist patriarchs that may or may not be Black, Indian, Chinese or Irish. Our reporter on the scene, herself a first-year pre-op transgender lesbian, self-reported\u00a0feeling\u00a0a deep sense of\u00a0guilt for single-handedly perpetuating the oppressive capitalist, colonial, patriarchal drink \u2018downing\u2019 culture.</p><hr><h1>4.\u00a0We are Warwick Five Free Education</h1><p></p><img class=\"alignleft size-post-thumbnail wp-image-1372\" src=\"https://thehoar.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/1973_demo_cov-960x593.jpg\" alt=\"1973_demo_cov\" width=\"960\" height=\"593\"><h2>And we\u2019re even better than your standard activists.</h2><p>Thousands of students each year flock to Warwick University, each of them bright and eager to learn more about their chosen degree.

Education up to the age of 18 is absolutely not enough, and it is bordering on blasphemy to even suggest that Higher Education, despite it\u2019s misleading name, is anything but <em>entirely necessary</em>\u00a0in order for people to be able to function in day-to-day life.</p><p>Once our inevitably swift success with our current campaign draws to an end, we shall be announcing plans for our newest endeavours, Warwick5FreeMoney5Everyone and Warwick5FreeLuxuryYachts, because everyone deserves more money (that\u2019s how it works, we promise).</p>",

Here\u2019s a step-by-step guide for those worried about\u00a0securing a\u00a02:1 in Pretentious Wanking.</p><h3>Step 1: attend roughly 62-64% of your term one and two lectures</h3><p>Learn from the best. Your lecturer \u2014 whose children recently disowned him because he talks about post-colonialism too much \u2014 knows exactly how to help you piss off your friends. \u201cGlobalisation is a post-modernist fallacy, and this is evident from public recitals of sixteenth\u00a0century French poetry in indigenous villages in Haiti.\u201d These were the words of Scme\u00fcot Bubin, professor\u00a0of history, who was lecturing budding first years in HI109,\u00a0<em>The Historiography of Pretentious Wanking</em>. \u201cConsequently, we don\u2019t hand out 2:1s willy-nilly, thus it is important as a result that you use at least three conjunctives per sentence\u201d, Bubin added.</p><h3>Step 2: purchase a copy of <i>Long Words: A Guide To Hiding What You Actually Mean</i></h3><p>RRP \u00a312 \u2014 A cost-effective way to learning all the words. \u201cI couldn\u2019t have written my 5,000 word essay without using \u2018thus\u2019 28 times,\u201d one second year English student told the <i>Hoar</i>. \u2018Thus\u2019 is defined as \u201ca really fucking fancy word for \u2018so\u2019 that can be used interchangeably with \u2018therefore\u2019\u201d. The English Department encourages all students to cite \u2018long words\u2019\u00a0in order to help them not answer the question. However, a leaked memorandum stated, \u201cChrist, if the students figure out some actual answers the department might get some fucking funding. We wouldn\u2019t want that\u201d.</p><h3>Step 3: learn your \u2018isms\u2019</h3><p>Whether its anthropomorphism, sectarianism, or Eurocentric conceptualisations of no-one-gives-a-toss nationalism, securing a 2:1 requires at least 3 \u2018isms\u2019 per essay. A mark scheme for the EC280 \u2014 Keynesianism and other irrelevant \u2018isms\u2019 stated, \u201cstudents who can correctly spell irrelevant \u201cisms\u201d, but have no understanding of what they mean, merit a 2:1 grading\u201d</p><p></p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1619\" src=\"https://thehoar.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/student_blogs_2438-copy.jpg\" alt=\"student_blogs_2438 copy\" width=\"849\" height=\"565\" srcset=\"https://thehoar.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/student_blogs_2438-copy.jpg 849w,https://thehoar.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/student_blogs_2438-copy-300x200.jpg 300w,https://thehoar.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/student_blogs_2438-copy-768x511.jpg 768w,https://thehoar.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/student_blogs_2438-copy-192x128.jpg 192w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 849px) 100vw, 849px\"><h3>Step 4: never shut up about your dissertation, essay, or revision</h3><p>\u201cAs previously discussed, the evidence suggests the Renaissance is a modernist construct perpetuated by nineteenth\u00a0century scholars,\u201d one history finalist told a Leamington local in Kelsey\u2019s at 2:45am last Saturday.</p><p>\u201cYes, but have you ever caught a weasel with your bare hands, licked it, and hurled it into the canal?\u201d, the local replied. The student was left bemused by the comment, since the claim lacked a single conjunctive.</p><h3>Step 5: graduate with a 2:1 in Pretentious Wanking</h3><p>\u201cEmployers want to know that you are capable of lying, hiding the truth, and pretending to have a clue what you\u2019re talking about\u201d, careers advice website <em>MyBoiledEgg</em> states. \u201cThus it is therefore ultimately a worthy exercise in aformentioning the available evidence in a synthesised claim towards a noteworthy conclusion\u201d, an English Lit graduate told the<i> Hoar</i>.

    "body": "<h2>The young adult\u2019s guide to acceptable levels of affection.</h2><p>In these stressful (and often highly emotive) pre-exam times it\u2019s understandable and <em>perfectly natural</em> that spending a lot of time in a room with similarly highly strung twenty-somethings for days, nights, and indeed weeks on end can lead to a certain amount of er, pent-up energy.</p><p>It is\u00a0recommended that such energy is released via regular breaks, frequent exercise and of course time set aside to be spent on your own stress-relieving strategy of choice. \u00a0You know best what works for you personally. However, after numerous complaints have been submitted, it seemed best to additionally gather some guidelines on what is acceptable within the campus study spaces.</p><h3>PDA level 1</h3><p>A brief embrace in the form of a hug is a very normal way to express support before or after an exam, or, for close friends, a form of greeting. A hug that has prolonged for two seconds or more however begins to tread questionable waters and it is recommended that such embraces are kept for private spaces for the comfort of everyone in the vicinity.</p><h3>PDA level 2</h3><p>Couples or those of particular cultural background may be accustomed to a peck on either the cheek or the mouth in the form of a greeting. Where kept as subtle as possible this is acceptable as a polite display of affection. More than one kiss on the mouth and more than two kisses on the cheek however does generally appear a bit excessive.</p><h3>PDA level 3</h3><p>It has been noted that some students find constant unrelenting physical contact with a partner to be a source of moral support. Although those who choose to engage in such hand-holding, gentle stroking or perhaps a hand on a knee are not necessarily to be reprimanded, it is recommended that such activities are kept to an absolute minimum and, where unavoidable, are undertaken with consideration of and respect for those around you. It is also suggested that you might like to learn to be an independent human and try working without receiving continuous physical and ontological reinforcement before you leave university.</p><h3>PDA level 4 and above</h3><p>Any activity which is likely to distract those around you or cross the boundary of particular levels of sensuousness above hand-holding should be undertaken with extreme caution. Reports of light hair stroking (and pulling), shoulder massaging, and kisses on necks have all become more frequently witnessed by students, and it is advised that such activities are not permitted anywhere within campus study spaces.</p><p>Moving slightly away from a quiet area or indeed working in a loud study space also does not make a passionate making-out session or an extended embrace acceptable. Furthermore, in areas where food and hot drinks can be taken into the rules also do not diminish, and eating each other\u2019s faces will not be tolerated. We urge any students who witness such behaviour of a PDA level four or above to report it immediately to a campus study team member, or fill in a form confidentially and place it in the deposit boxes which will be placed in the vicinity of all study space exits.</p><hr><p>It is a pleasure to report that the campus study team has also made the decision to provide relationship services during exam season. Free sexual health advice, contraception and lubricant will all be available to students with the proviso that such services will be made use of at home only. For those recently dumped or eternally single, the study team will also be able to listen to dull stories about revision and any recently watched TV programs on request, in place of the student finding an actual partner. Please ask any of the supervisors for more information on this scheme.</p><p>We hope that you find this brief guide helpful in navigating the boundaries of both campus relationships <em>and </em>examinations, and wish you the best of luck in maintaining both of these important, yet hopefully separate, parts of your student experience.</p>",

However, at least it\u2019s in a kidnapper\u2019s interest to keep you well fed, vaguely rested, and not beat up to bad. In comparison, whilst\u00a0on the U12, especially for any poor bugger over six feet, even standard seating requires agonising contortion. Not least if you are standing, or sitting in some awkward cubby hole. Not only that, you can\u2019t even fucking eat on there. Not that you\u2019d want to anyway \u2014 \u00a0with air as fresh as a Beijing bypass \u2014 cracking open a pack of pungent prawn cocktail Pringles isn\u2019t going to make you any friends.</p><p>The options for worldly troubles are running thin.

Apparently, to be so permanently on the cusp of death is intolerable.

The panel also happened to agree on no-platforming, safe spaces, profiling, the hijab, and \u2014 well \u2014 everything else that was mentioned in the hour long \u2018discussion\u2019.</p><p>You might notice some irony about a situation in which proponents of debate spend an hour agreeing with each other to an audience of people who all probably already hold their opinions, in opposition to a group of people not given an ability to discuss their view.</p><p>What\u2019s worse is the panel\u2019s depiction of their ideological opponents was without any depth or understanding for why they hold their position. You can make fun of the idea of safe space rooms with teddy bears by pretending to suck your thumb, but you can\u2019t expect anybody who favours safe spaces to be challenged by that or compelled change their mind. It\u2019s far more effective to explain why the proponents want such a room and what the associated problems are. It\u2019s frustrating enough listening to people you agree with for a long time and not learning anything, but it\u2019s more frustrating still, when they\u2019re not even doing a good job of supporting your position.</p><p>I spend more time than I would like to admit listening to people arguing on the internet about social issues, and I can say that those who argue\u00a0in favour of safe spaces and no-platforming all do so with good intentions to protect people they feel have societal difficulties, often whilst also favouring free speech. They state that no-platforming doesn\u2019t oppose free speech because that only protects you from the government, not from universities who they believe should not want to advertise views that could cause harm, since some people will agree even if most students prefer the counter arguments.</p><p>Although I think a strong case can be made against the way no-platforming and safe spaces are being used, trying to argue against the proponents views without actually debating one of them will often result in straw-men and mischaracterisation (which I sincerely hope I didn\u2019t just do). The result made me and my fellow liberals look foolish in front of any audience members who might have disagreed.</p><p>It should be noted that there were a couple attempts at some cool refreshing devil\u2019s advocate during the drought of disagreement and there was one attempt to find somebody in the audience looking to defend the <a href=\"https://thehoar.org/blog/2016/04/20/why-did-the-nus-delegates-vote-for-an-anti-semite-well-it-is-420/\">presidency of Malia Bouattia</a>, however the chosen audience member wanted her to be president for the same reason they wanted Trump to be president: so that there would never be someone like her again. There were a couple other hands in favour, but the chair did not call on them to speak.</p><p>Perhaps there\u2019s nothing wrong with having a speaker for one side of an argument so long as there is a Q&A session in which to properly scrutinise them. Q&A sounds\u00a0great, however the session at this event was far from adequate.</p><p>The penultimate questioner stated that they had \u201cheard a mischaracterisation of [their] views\u201d. They repeated Maryam Namazie\u2019s statement: \u201cIf you\u2019re going to go somewhere where everyone agrees with you, what\u2019s the point?\u201d They called upon the audience to ask why they were here. They asked why it wasn\u2019t a debate and why they were not on the panel as an opposition.</p><p>No response was given, and the chair found another question, causing members of the audience to turn their heads to our ignored questioner in confusion over the lack of response. Maryam, after answering the replacement question, stated that she didn\u2019t understand what the previous questioner was getting at and said that someone else should address it. But Benjamin declared that time was up, and the event ended.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t applaud after what felt like such a blatant dismissal.</p><p>Regardless of how many in the audience\u00a0shared my disappointment, regardless of how many in the audience take the time to listen to other points of view in depth, what transpired made the room look like fools \u2014 hypocrites in our own echo chamber.</p><hr><h2>Addendum</h2><p>In the interest of\u00a0balance I\u2019d like to state the following:</p><ul><li>Another speaker, Douglas Murray, was supposed to attend, who would have found reason to disagree with the panel on some issues, but on the headline issue about free speech in universities there would still have been agreement.</li><li>It is also possible our penultimate audience member\u00a0was mistaken for giving a statement\u00a0as they initially said they had a question for the audience (\u201cwhy are you here?\u201d), before\u00a0adding the questions to the panel about why it wasn\u2019t a debate.</li></ul>",

But let\u2019s be honest, you\u2019re not going to do anything about it \u2014 just yet. You are still reading this. Luckily, high marks are nowhere near as important as looking good.</p><p>Below are eight suggestions for outfits that will help you as you struggle to get dressed in the morning.</p><h3>1. \u2018I\u2019ve Slept In My Clothes Again\u2019 otherwise known as the \u2018Day-To-Night-Back-To-Day\u2019 Look</h3><p>This banger of an outfit will leave you pale and confused as you wake up with yesterday\u2019s clothes clinging damply to your skin. But you\u2019re already ready and raring to go!</p><h3>2. Change your hairstyle</h3><p>If you are a finalist, these are your last few days of freedom. So let your hair down and bleach it. As we all know, dyeing your hair a whacky colour is shorthand for \u2018I\u2019m coping just fine.\u2019</p><h3>3. The Rockstar circa 1970</h3><p>How to achieve this look? Go to the library stairwell and call your mother. She will sound concerned. Promise yourself you won\u2019t cry. Cry. Your mascara will run all down your face. Style this out by saying to people that you are starting an Alice Cooper tribute act.</p><p></p><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1681\" src=\"https://thehoar.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/2015-09-16-22.58.48-225x300.jpg\" alt=\"2015-09-16 22.58.48\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https://thehoar.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/2015-09-16-22.58.48-225x300.jpg 225w,https://thehoar.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/2015-09-16-22.58.48-768x1024.jpg 768w,https://thehoar.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/2015-09-16-22.58.48-144x192.jpg 144w,https://thehoar.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/2015-09-16-22.58.48.jpg 960w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 225px) 100vw, 225px\"><h3>4. The Onesie</h3><p>Lad. You will be the talk of everyone\u2019s WhatsApp group. Everyone will be mightily impressed by how little effort you\u2019ve made. Which leads us onto 5.</p><h3>5. \u2018The Male Engineer\u2019 Look</h3><p>Guys, dig out that Superdry hoodie and jeans combo that you have been wearing every day since you got here. This low maintenance look really extends to all men, regardless of subject. Sit back, relax, and be judged more on your abilities rather than your appearance. Men, just do what you want. But women! Dress properly for the library. People have a hard time taking us seriously <em>as is</em>.</p><h3>6. The Bird</h3><p>You know early in the morning when you go to speak but it sometimes comes out as a squawk because you\u2019ve got something in your throat? That never really goes away in term three as you talk to so few people, except to complain. Rather, The Something engorges itself on the energy you used to spend socialising.

In fact, academics are of little interest to these institutions. What they want is a clear evidence of interest in the Divestment industry and demonstration of that elusive environmental awareness. Exhibiting interest is easy enough at Warwick with a whole host of societies catering for the industry. We recommend the recently founded Virtual Divestment Club. If you want neat tips and tricks to get behind in the world of finance, remember to pickup your <em>Countryside Careers Series: Divestment Handbook</em> for more information.</p><p>Extracurricular activities allow you to express in-demand skills.

While little tangible difference is made to the running of the university and it\u2019s investment in oil and gas companies, the occupation of university property demonstrates teamwork and enthusiasm in the face of futility.</p><h5>Tests and interviews</h5><p>Compulsory numerical and critical thinking tests provide an opportunity to show off the transitory skills of your degree while interviews consist of intellectually challenging technical and environmental questions.</p><p>But it\u2019s not all stress and competition, the application process provides plenty of downtime to mix with (both of) the other applicants. We recommend diffusing the tension by bonding over a shared musical predilection. The Hoar finance editor\u2019s current Spotify Playlist include: The Libortines, The FooTSE Fighters, Johnny Cash, Lloyd Banks and most perversely The LostProfits.</p><h5 class=\"p6\"><span class=\"s2\">Spring yourself into a Summer Placement (No pun intern-ded)\u00a0</span></h5><p>Due to domination of the industry by sociopaths, an array of Affirmative Action schemes have been launched by disillusioned former employees.</p><p>While this has led to more entry level positions for the empathetic and morally sound people of this world, we are wary of wholesale improvement unless things change in the upper strata of the divestment game.</p><p>As unpaid internships remain the preserve of parent-pushed achievers, prissy posh summer-costs-covered types, and living-cost-covered Londoners, The Divestment Banking industry generally avoids formal foot in the door programs. So you won\u2019t even have to worry about early applications, converting internships, schmoozing the powers that be, and sabotaging your competitors for the role. Hell, a summer spent \u2018finding yourself\u2019 in the narcotic haze of the Andes will likely be better prep for divestment banking than any city scheme can offer.</p><h4>CV and LinkedIn</h4><p>For those wasting away in Human Resources, there is nothing more salacious than a systematically-assembled CV, Power Letter and LinkedIn profile. We advocate following a similar structure to a recent successful applicant:</p><figure id=\"attachment_426\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-426\"  class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"https://thehoar.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Untitled.png\"><img class=\"wp-image-426 size-medium_large\" src=\"https://thehoar.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Untitled-768x1087.png\" alt=\"(If you learn one thing in Warwick\u2019s corporate paradise, let it be CV writing \u2014ed.)\" width=\"768\" height=\"1087\" srcset=\"https://thehoar.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Untitled-768x1087.png 768w,https://thehoar.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Untitled-212x300.png 212w,https://thehoar.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Untitled-724x1024.png 724w,https://thehoar.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Untitled-136x192.png 136w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\"></a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-426\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">(If you learn one thing in Warwick\u2019s corporate paradise, let it be spelling\u00a0\u2014ed)</figcaption></figure><h5>Becoming an analyst and exit opportunities</h5><p>Being an analyst is arduous and demanding. You will be working interminable hours, wading through monotonous spreadsheets and socialising with colleagues described by one former analyst as \u2018sanctimonious gits\u2019. However, the three years of slaving away will be worth it when you reach the promised land of Private Inequity and Hedge Cutting.</p><p>Low salaries are supplemented by a favourable daily bonus system, consisting of happiness, moral riches and Aristotelian self-realisation. Applicants should be wary of job insecurity during periods of economic boom. There are widespread fears of the consequences to bonuses if George Osborne\u2019s long term economic plan was to finally come to fruition. Nonetheless,the job certainly comes with its perks. Bark-lays recently opened \u2018Walden\u2019, an organic, dairy-free, locally produced worker\u2019s canteen on premises. TripAdvisor currently rates it at 4/5, with one recent visitor, \u2018BobbyDiamond12\u2019 raving, \u2018the Li Boar casserole was a steal at \u00a33.50\u2019. That\u2019s not to forget the attractive international opportunities. An analyst at Woodman Sacks recently raved about a Team Building Protest exercise in Westminster and the annual conservation trip to Costa Rica, while ten lucky analysts at Lizard will spend 6 months on secondment at their international office in Vanuatu.</p><p>The public have not taken well to these supposed bonuses with happiness being seen as detrimental to the capitalist endgame. Despite this, we at the Hoar couldn\u2019t be prouder than Jeremy Hunt\u2019s mum in seeing upstanding Warwick graduates enter the industry. So, if you\u2019re more conservationist than conservative, more Thoreau than Trump, and really care about making a difference in the world, carpe noctem, and become a Divestment Banker.</p><blockquote class=\"aligncenter\"><p>Waste no more time arguing about what a good man should be.

    "body": "<p>The King James Bible is the most bought (and in all probability most read) book in the world. And to to make a slightly pathetic joke, they don\u2019t call it The Good Book for no reason. Well written or not, believed or not, its status as the most ubiquitous tome of all time makes it important.\u00a0 Especially important for literature students, given its far-reaching impact on other works of all descriptions.</p><p>Every storyline, and every emotion can be found within this book. Here is somewhere you should feel at home. After all, even if you are not a believer, Mass is merely a collection of narratives and songs; repeated and repeated and repeated. Trying, with hopeful expectation, to glean a little more out of them each time. Truly, you can draw anything out of any line of literature, and a good sermon will not only prove it but also reveal the garden path leading you there.</p><p>Written by roughly 40 people, from kings to paupers, in times of prosperity or poverty, freedom or war, and ranging over 1500 years, your opportunities for contextual exploration are boundless. As a literature student, this in itself should be enough to have you drooling at the mouth. Alongside the random occurrences of great names like Mahershalalhashbaz (when the priest will inevitably inform the congregation that the difficulty in pronunciation is necessarily akin to the struggles of Jesus Our Saviour carrying the weight of our sins). I can confidently predict that you\u2019ll soon be lying prostrate on the floor, weeping with the realisation of the greatness of God almighty. \u00a0Of course as good Catholics we will all hasten to scorn such an outburst of emotion in the House of God. Such specific joy is to be found in such creative madness.</p><p>Therefore, I, Evangelina de Rosa, challenge all literature students to attend Mass, and see for yourselves the celebration of literature and its analysis brought to repetitive life. Collected works of prose, verse and the oral tradition and presented in one hour a week.</p><p>Naturally, I hope that in coming to Mass, you discover the truth of God\u2019s words as interpreted for us by the Holy See. Nevertheless, until then, a good literature student will be able to wonder as the Nicene Creed is spoken if Jesus really did come down from heaven only for \u201cmen\u201d, and if this is an anti-feminist attack from the upper echelons of the Roman Catholic Church.</p>",

Napoleon knew a good bar when he saw one\u00a0but \u2014\u00a0medical evidence suggests \u2014 even if he were still a Leamington resident, he would probably be too dead to easily frequent the Kelsey\u2019s.\u00a0<span id=\"more-266\"></span></p><hr><p>There\u2019s a biggish house in Leam\u00a0called Napoleon House. It\u2019s at\u00a06\u00a0Clarendon Square, just down the road from the Shell garage opposite Smack (Ed. \u2014 could Napoleon\u00a0visit\u00a0Smack?) and,\u00a0for about\u00a0a year between 1838 and 1839, Prince\u00a0Louis-Napol\u00e9on Bonaparte lived there.</p><p>Louis-Napol\u00e9on was third son of the really famous Napoleon\u2019s little brother. He was adept at leading unsuccessful coups, but won one by mistake in 1848 so led another against himself. He won that too and ended up in charge of France for longer than anyone since.</p><p>Rewind to the years after he fucked up\u00a0his first coup, and we find Louis living\u00a0in exile in London.\u00a0In search of lower rent, our friendly French throne pretender consented to rent\u00a0a house in North Leam (it is not known whether he secured a 44 week let, or avoided the 88 penny admin fee).</p><p>Certainly, however, Louis began a lasting French tradition for the\u00a0young, loud\u00a0and exiled to travel to\u00a0Warwick.</p><p>Unfortunately, the eternal appeal of unsuccessful coups \u2014 as junkies everywhere know \u2014 quickly dragged Louis back to London, and then to France.\u00a0<a href=\"http://thetab.com/uk/warwick/2016/02/08/i-love-kelseys-12082\" target=\"_blank\">The thing</a> is, had Louis stayed in Leamington long enough to see Kelsey\u2019s, would he be a patron?</p><figure id=\"attachment_290\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-290\"  class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img class=\"wp-image-290 size-medium_large\" src=\"https://thehoar.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/IMG_2331-768x576.jpg\" alt=\"Standing proudly.\" width=\"768\" height=\"576\" srcset=\"https://thehoar.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/IMG_2331-768x576.jpg 768w,https://thehoar.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/IMG_2331-300x225.jpg 300w,https://thehoar.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/IMG_2331-1024x768.jpg 1024w,https://thehoar.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/IMG_2331-192x144.jpg 192w,https://thehoar.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/IMG_2331.jpg 1550w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-290\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Standing proudly.</figcaption></figure><p>Kelsey\u2019s is a fine establishment. Few bars in Warwickshire maintain so\u00a0adhesive a floor patina. Few are so ecologically minded as to shun hot water, hand dryers and glass-cleaning. Few have the confidence to employ staff without training, or to invent a potent and disgusting drink whose recipe reads like page one of the\u00a0Tesco.com booze section sorted \u2018Price: low-high\u2019. Few have embraced\u00a0mountain-pool, in which tables feature unexpected\u00a0gradients, ridges and other obstacles. \u00a0Few allow their bouncers\u00a0such freedom\u00a0to indulge their prejudices.\u00a0Few stand so bleakly\u00a0between a used car forecourt and a railway bridge.\u00a0Few attract a clientele\u00a0so adept at handling broken bottles in anger.</p><p>But is this the stuff of prospective emperors? Would\u00a0Louis consent to attend the workshop of intoxication that is Kelsey\u2019s? Yes. Probably. Emperors are\u00a0normally pretty thirsty, pretty bloodthirsty\u00a0or\u00a0\u2014 at the very least \u2014 pretty tasteless.</p><p>The hitch? Poor old Louis was born in 1808 and would be 207 years old at the moment. In reality, he died way back in 1873, aged 64.\u00a0Although the stress of being\u00a0French Emperor for some twenty years probably knocked a few decades off his life expectancy, it\u2019s unrealistic to expect him even to have lived to see his 200th birthday.</p><p>If\u00a0Louis had stayed in Warwick, he would probably be quite profoundly dead.</p><p>But would\u00a0that preclude him from patronising Kelsey\u2019s? I think not. The joy of Kelsey\u2019s \u2014 the very reason any of us make repeat visits to such an overwhelming shit-hole \u2014 is that being dead, practically dead or just about dead to the world isn\u2019t really a problem there.</p><p>Pass out on a pool table anywhere else and you\u2019ll be asked to leave. At Kelsey\u2019s a short rude chap with a walkie-talkie will poke you in the eye,\u00a0tell you to stand the fuck up and\u00a0start shouting at someone else.</p><p>Piss on a girl\u2019s leg in the smoking area? Instead of being arrested, expect\u00a0a stern talking to. Throw up in a glass? Give it to the barman when he comes round for glasses. Break the glass? No one notices. Break a\u00a0friend\u2019s nose? Still no one notices.</p><p>There\u2019s nothing conventionally nice about Kelsey\u2019s.\u00a0The eternal, and only, appeal of the place\u00a0is that it\u2019s the one bar where you\u00a0probably <em>could</em> spend an evening talking to a dead European emperor. In\u00a0fact, you probably <em>have</em> spent an evening talking to a dead European emperor there.</p>",

Inspirational.</p><p>Even before we have fully accounted for the absence of our philanthropist, he is back. Back, chiefly, on Facebook. Fourteen hundred photos of paths, clouds, feet and tourist industry employees are uploaded. A pat-on-the-back\u00a0blog post (the first since the goodbye) is posted.

Don\u2019t take it personally \u2014 it\u2019s not your fault; you could be MLK handing out puppies to the blind and you\u2019d still be a monster. A monster to me \u2014 a student \u2014 with my processed and pre-packaged mentality of futile transgression. For sure I don\u2019t want to change anything, that\u2019d look terrible on my CV; I just don\u2019t want to have to\u2026 think. It\u2019s far easier to fall into the similitude of a subversive student and post vague infographics attacking your pay packet in-between filing spring week applications eyeing the rich kid\u2019s road map to a meaty monetary landing of my own.</p><p>And what is it about your pay? \u00a3600k?</p><p>Surely a stalwart critic of the neoliberal paradigm published the world over, who has clawed an institution of 25,000-odd up the international rankings, so as to battle off the red-brick giants with their endowments and entrenched aura of entitlements \u2014 so as to deliver the next generation of flannel suited Forbes enthusiasts \u2014 all the while publishing contemporary research \u2014 doesn\u2019t deserve the deliberations of an independent pay-setting committee to grant him some juicy compensation.</p><p>Oh the injustice!</p><p>How can you be earning <em>all</em> that while try as I might Daddy\u2019s allowance won\u2019t stretch to even a term of tequilas in the Bacchanalian bathtub of excess that is Pop? When was the last time you went \u2018out\u2019, eh Thrift? Did you crack open a bottle of bubbly when you sealed the deal on the 50th anniversary logo change? But, O Bald One, O archetype of male, pale, and stale \u2013 why didn\u2019t you consult me on this? Why pay a panel of proven marketing masters to tack together a condensed representation of the institution when you could have just consulted me? Don\u2019t you realise that you\u2019ve wrecked havoc with my self importance Nigel? Aren\u2019t you aware how many of my micro-aggressions this triggers?</p><p>I\u2019m sorry, <em>t\u00eat d\u2019oeuf</em>, but I hate it. I hate its smarmy double V formation, and how it neatly fits with a smorgasbord of other promotional graphics. I should have had a say!</p><p>Sure it\u2019s going to be the icon of the university for the next few decades\u2026</p><p>Sure I\u2019m only here for another year and half but\u2026 don\u2019t you get it Nigel?? I am <em>me</em> \u2014 a well-heeled, well-spoken landed student with nothing real in my life to fight for and a burning ambition to fit into the toothless blind echo-chamber of student politics.</p><p>What\u2019s more, deep down I\u2019m a conservative. No, not the card-carrying baby eating phlegmatic political party conservative \u2014 but the more insidious type; I don\u2019t like new and different things \u2014 between you and I: my confirmation bias is recalcitrant; my tendency to react, sharp; my pre-frontal lobes too small, and my adrenal glands too big. You changed the order Nigel, and that really bugs me.</p><p>It bugs me as much as the marketisation of campus. Did you not see the post I shared from the questionably Semite-friendly Facebook page about the Rothschild dynasty? It\u2019s the banks, man! The banks \u2014 they\u2019re after your soul \u2014 the governments of the world are in their pockets. They\u2019re stealing their juicy bonuses from the mouths of the starving billion. And yet here they are on campus, you can\u2019t walk 10ft without Morgan Stanley slipping you a complementary pen, and all because of you.</p><p>Tell me Nigel, did they take your hair when they took your soul? So what if you\u2019re trying to use corporate money to fill a hole in funding formed by a lack of an historic aristocratic support base or a big bundle of property to piddle away when winnings are wanted? So what if I decide to surreptitiously slip behind enemy lines and become a substance sniffing city-sycophant myself? I thought you were a Marxist, Thrifty. Who cares if it is said that the capitalist will sell you the rope with which to hang him? What matters is that you are not fulfilling my simplistic idea of what I expect you to be in the face of the farcical question of funding. You should behave better.</p><p>And, while you\u2019re at it, get the local police to behave better too. I shouldn\u2019t expect to see an inadequate task force of unsuspecting officers, sent to deal with a deliverance of assault, act in panic as they are baited by an endless stream of screaming students putting their hands behind their backs and salmon-flopping onto surprised lumps of high-vis flesh whilst hurling classic one-liners such as \u201cfuck off him, fuck off him now\u201d. Have you seen the footage Nigel? Do you know how hard it is to attack an officer without actually hitting them? Are you aware of the distress tied to stringing together a novel set of shitty metaphors and images about the protests to plug next to my name and selfie in every student publication?</p><p>That is, when I\u2019m not writing about free-education. Speaking of which, why should I, the one who benefits from my degree, have to pay for my ride in university? Don\u2019t the detritus amongst uneducated, unwashed, sclerotic masses of quasi-sentient taxpaying troglodytes not realise just how much they benefit from my paper ticket to prosperity? Why don\u2019t they pay for it? The bunch of bigots could for once take their collective thumbs out of their respective arses, stop voting UKIP, and actually do something for the civic good: namely fund my way to that dream job at KPMG. I\u2019ll even pay my taxes, until I can afford not, that is. Think of all the breadcrumbs of my potential prosperity they are missing out on. Don\u2019t you ever think of the poor, Nigel? Why don\u2019t you fight harder for my idea of higher education funding?</p><p>So Nigel, once you accept that you are fundamentally flawed on a score of universals, then this can all be water under the bridge. We can part ways on amicable terms, and I can wish you all the best for governing the inner cantons of hell without a pang of guilt. Until then, take this as my sorry-not-sorry olive leaf of reconciliation.</p><p>Yours Sanctimoniously,</p><p>T Fund</p><blockquote class=\"aligncenter\"><p>Equality, I spoke their word, as if a wedding vow, but I was so much older then, I\u2019m younger than that now.<br><small>Bob Dylan</small></p></blockquote>",

    "body": "<p>I write to you all because in today\u2019s day and age it\u2019s of paramount importance that minorities are protected from malicious discriminations and given a safe space. In today\u2019s climate of homophobia, Anti-Semitism, Misogyny, Man Hating, white privilege abusing, black hating, rich loathing, poor baiting, immigrant bashing, a-sexual dating, benefit demonising, vegetarian eating media culture, I feel that I must stand up for the minority to which I belong. Me. The Asians make up only 5% of the country The Blacks just 2%. The Muslims 4% and The Jews only one and a half. But I am just me. Only a little bit of a little bit of a percent. Only Me!</p><p>My minority does not mean that I get to slip under the radar however, oh no. Intersectionality shows how my oppressions are as deep as they are wide. The mechanisms of abuse and persecution are superimposed twelve times over for me! I\u2019m not gay so The Sraight Haters get me there, I\u2019m not a man so The Misogynists get me there (as well as those Lad Culture Banter Boys). I believed in Yaweh last year but changed to Krushna now so that\u2019s both The Anti-Semites and The Hindu Haters who I have to watch out for! Mean whilst the Muslim extremists hate me for not being like them, (as do many of the other muslims, since being white, Ialso find to my horror I\u2019m a cog in their oppression) The feminists hate me because I don\u2019t say I\u2019m one of them. Labour Students taunt me since I didn\u2019t join them and The Conservatives have me on a blacklist because I said no to them too. (Yet I still get no sympathy for my Liberal Democrat principles. On which note The Lefty students hate me for my U-turn on tuition fees.) I\u2019m missing my pinkie on my left foot so the eugenicists hate me for being disabled, whilst the disability rights advocates also hate me, because apparently my disability doesn\u2019t really count. Whilst I\u2019m not lucky enough to have dyslexia or be short-sighted, tests have revealed that I am in fact really quite stupid, but I get no compensation there.</p><p>So you see it\u2019s really hard being in a minority. It\u2019s really hard being Me. I have no safe space where I can stop people disagreeing with me, unlike some of these more <em>popular</em> \u2018minorities\u2019. I hate to say it again, but I\u2019m just me, totally alone and with no-one in the world to share my oppression with. I\u2019m working class so The State hates me, but I\u2019m also a student so The Working class hate me too. Sometimes it feels like everyone hates me.</p><p>The worst bit is that no-one respects my minority. Alright I haven\u2019t got a name for it yet, but when I try to use mine people just look at me funny. Nowadays when people ask for respect under their own name its just not enough, you have to use one of the big ones. You\u2019re a nobody without a minority name and the bigger the better. The way I see it Labour works pretty well among young people, much better than Conservative, but these require a bit too much reading and study to be believable. The best ones are those that you can be born into. Jew and Muslim really work well at the moment (although you can volunteer in and out of those ones if you work really, really hard, but everyone will hate you for it). The first has perhaps the biggest historical advantage, but their constantly at risk of being perceived as one of The Isreali\u2019s and hated for it of course. The latter however have really put on a turn of speed. They\u2019ve even just had a new prejudice named for themselves! It\u2019s called Islamophobia! Just ten years fresh thanks to those Jihadi Extremists who just hate <em>everyone</em> straight and simple, problem for The Muslims is that it\u2019s The Jihadists who hate them the absolute most! You see hate today isn\u2019t just multiplying, It\u2019s tribalising, the Islamophobes can\u2019t stand the anti-fascists, the white haters can\u2019t stand the black haters, nor the women haters the men haters. I really feel that something needs to be done</p><p>So, I\u2019m publishing a new dictionary of discrimination next week and I\u2019m going to make sure my name is in it. They\u2019ll all hate me thrice over once I\u2019ve written this anyway.</p><p>Peace be upon you,</p><p>Angela Victim</p>",

    "body": "<p>Peeling from the easy chair, I\u2019ve had enough of reading \u2014 the time for taking in words is through \u2014 better to put pen to paper and forge something for all to flavour and forget. It\u2019s a short stroll to the desk, same routine, chair out, crack the shutters, sit down. The sun has turned in, yet in the early weeks of the year that spells only the start of the spaced out nameless hours before any time worth caring about. The hours under the rational hand of caffeine are through, I need to change my poison. Draining the dregs of last night\u2019s efforts, I commence afresh. A new day, a new bottle, a new journey into the honeyed madness of freedom from the senses. Riffling through an army of notes, novels and nameless jottings-never-developed \u2013 my hand embraces the leathery shell of a weathered matchbox. The record skips as the bittersweet smell of a fresh pouch of tobacco mingles with its musty surroundings. I\u2019m proud of my packing as I pull the pipe to my lips, all three stages executed with rare precision. I fumble into a false light, drag, and let the embers wither as the body of warmth works down to the core. Then I light for good \u2014 the tang of tobacco tickles my tongue. The taste and the heat are tinder to the sparks in my mind. The room clouds to a yellowish haze, as I litter with words the pages before me.</p><p>Romantic, eh?</p><p>Yet believably false. In truth, I\u2019m in the Rootes grid. The aroma is not the burning of amber leaves but that of sweat, disappointment, and the sour chive sandwich spilt onto my workspace by the internship hunting sniffler next to me. The shrill wail of the ventilation system is tortuous; surely this drill of ill-oiled equipment is far more pertinent to my health that the clean air it supposedly provides?</p><p>I want to escape and smoke, but the sordid pack of Slovakian imports sits firmly in pocket for now. I haven\u2019t the heart to waste one, for what? A small diversion to a squalid pissy corner of campus for a solo drag in the cold February night? What, I wonder, is the foundation for the closing of this pleasurable outlet? Permit me to posit my view; there\u2019s no solid reason not to embrace smoking, and smokers, into your life.</p><blockquote class=\"alignleft\"><p>Imagine Hepburn or Dylan without the cigarette \u2014 without the fire they lose the flame.</p></blockquote><p>One reason for this I\u2019ve already touched upon, <em>smoking is cool</em>, I\u2019m sorry \u2014 I know from birth you\u2019ve been conditioned to say the contrary \u2014 you may even add <em>\u00e1 chacun ses g\u00f4uts</em>, and I may be inclined to agree with the latter. But then I ask you to imagine Hepburn without the cigarette holder, or Dylan, with his anarchic tangle of hair and sunglasses \u2014 but minus the stub of a dying smoke \u2014 without the fire they lose the flame. Would Kelseys not be far less of a sclerotic afterthought of a bar if it had the added effect of a hanging fog of mysterious smoke</p><blockquote class=\"alignright\"><p>From this connection with death smoking gets its transgressive aesthetic.</p></blockquote><p>But why do we find smoking so cool? One postulation would be that smokers are people who have clearly endured exposure to every authoritarian source telling them what and whatnot to put in their bodies, and in taking up tobacco, raised a middle finger to prying powers. I can\u2019t imagine anyone truly thinks that \u2018smokers\u2019 (I hate even using that term, as if giving them a label makes it easier to collectivise and denigrate what is fundamentally a group of human beings), aren\u2019t aware that with their puffing they are knocking minutes from their lives by turning their lungs black with tar. But it\u2019s from this connection with death that smoking derives its transgressive aesthetic. It is this power over what is \u2018good\u2019 and \u2018evil\u2019 that flavours the intangible allure of flying in the face of utility. Perhaps it\u2019s fitting that the earliest account of smoking in Europe is attributed to Rodrigo de Jerez, a crewmate of Columbus \u2014 he was found with what was believed to be the devil\u2019s fire flaring from his mouth and nostrils, and consequently beaten and jailed for seven years.</p><blockquote class=\"alignleft\"><p>Be careful not to die decades before you enter the dirt.</p></blockquote><p>Then let\u2019s juxtapose this conception with the converse, the \u2018antitabagists\u2019. Why is it that health fanatics seem to be so adept at draining you of the force they fight to defend? One the one hand, the battle against the power to puff is fought by the Gillian McKeiths of the world, the freedom hating hags of health, who all the while giggle with glee as you empty your pockets on some rip-off quinoa equivalent that they\u2019re selling. On the other, it\u2019s the fag-hating despots: James I, Napoleon, Hitler, your mother.</p><p>For me, anyone who is keen to tell you what you should and shouldn\u2019t put in your mouth, can be carefully clumped into the category of <em>uncool</em>.<br>\nAnd as for the live and let live liberals in the middle. I implore, do as you please, of course, but be careful not die decades before you enter the dirt. <em>Something\u2019s</em> got to kill you. They say cigarettes will kill me, but they won\u2019t say when. What\u2019s more, when trying to eke out a few extra hours at the tail end of one\u2019s existence, you may lose track of an essential wisdom \u2014 an awareness firmly in the minds of the ancients; from The Buddha to Nietzsche via the Wisdom of Silenus we see the eternal recurrence of an irrepressible idea; <em>life is suffering</em>, rationalisations away from this, at best, flattering illusions. Cigarette in hand, the smoker leaps on the back of the blind restless beast of existential suffering \u2014 and grants an unequivocal <em>fuck you</em> to the world that says you must torture yourself to prolong the Socratic sickness of life. If you\u2019re going to have vices, at least make them enjoyable.</p><blockquote class=\"alignright\"><p>Of all my flaws, smoking is my favourite.</p></blockquote><p>Enjoyment; that leads me to the next point. Of all my flaws, smoking is my favourite. A cigarette can start a conversation, add character to a barroom, enhance a moment, relieve anxious clatterings of the mind, call for a reflective pause, and I daresay taste pleasant. People shell out what they do for good reason.</p><p>Pleasure isn\u2019t everything, my next defence is a touch harder to quantify. The community of people who have taken the leap into the arms of big baccy\u2019 exist in a strange state of solidarity beyond the conventional world of input, output, production, payment and exchange that characterises the modern world. Rather, in smoking, we see the peculiar levelling force of having all walks of life congregate into the few foetid corners that society permits them \u2014 to share lights, smokes and words. Where else would it be ordinary to see a broker ask a builder for the favour of a fag? Perhaps this is threatened by iterative excessive tax drives. Yet even the collective shunning faced by each individual present in a smoking circle provides a small flare of comradery. Smoking is one of the few remaining gift economies \u2014 a paradise being elsewhere lost.</p><p>I\u2019m no salesman, that\u2019s enough on why one may wish to pick up a habit, now to tackle the true behemoth, to cut through the smokescreen of shit surrounding cigarettes. I\u2019ve alluded to the first; habits \u2014 habit forming \u2014\u00a0and the big one, addiction. As a spotty pubescent adolescent I was warned that, not only would smoking cost me \u00a320,000 a year (apparently enough for a Speedboat), it would only take three cigarettes until I\u2019m hooked for life. And why risk three? After all, one will lead to another, and that\u2019ll lead to another, and <em>gasp</em>, the steel hook of Imperial Tobacco will pierce my cheek and reel me into the family destroying dark world of addiction.</p><blockquote class=\"alignleft\"><p>Strangely, caffeine is something I do find incredibly habit forming.</p></blockquote><p>Perhaps it\u2019s just me, but a few hundred smokes in and I still couldn\u2019t call myself an addict. I don\u2019t smoke as many days as I do, and, if I haven\u2019t the cash nor the fitting milieu, I can go weeks at a time without a single drag. Equally, in the caffeinated haze (strangely, caffeine is something I do find incredibly habit forming) of essay deadline season, putting away a pack a day is no surprising feat. In<em> Junky: The Definitive Texts on Junk</em>, William S. Burroughs extends this insight even to heroin, certainly one can become addicted, but it requires a fairly intense programme of forging a habit over a matter of months. The same can be said of many of life\u2019s other peculiarities \u2014 hell, there was a time in my life when two or three days without taking a run would drive me to the bounds of sanity. As such, I suggest that addiction is what you make of it \u2014 if you\u2019re a neural conservative desperate to drop daily traditions into your life, traditions you only relinquish with agonising recalcitrance, then perhaps smoking isn\u2019t for you. Conversely, if you have a level head, then you shouldn\u2019t let a fear of yourself stand in the way of filling it with smoke.</p><p>A quick tipple to tackle: the environment. You\u2019re told from time to time as a smoker that not only are you pumping fumes into our clogged air, but also you are consuming tracts of land that could otherwise be feeding the world. For the former, the greenhouse effect of smoke is of course negated by photosynthesis in the tobacco plant. Any malign effects come from transportation, production and packaging \u2013 a point I\u2019ll deal with soon. As for land use, come back to me when you\u2019ve cut meat from your diet. Vegetarian? Fine, come back to me once you\u2019ve lobbied your government to cut biofuel subsidies. Activist too? Okay, a) go out and live your life, b) convert your (let\u2019s face, likely ample; sanctimonious behaviour like yours can only come from a background of privilege) lawns into arable land and stop telling everyone what to do with their lives. However, the silver bullet in this argument comes not from such pedants, but the frank truth that smokers simply don\u2019t live as long as non-smokers. So in your last few years of blasting your beamer down the city streets, we\u2019ll be peacefully feeding the worms, and you\u2019ll make up the lost ground in no time.</p><p>While we\u2019re working through the low hanging fruit, how about the second hand effects. I hope it should suffice for me to say that, if you ask me not to harm your health with my fumes, I\u2019d ask you not to drive down streets where pedestrians wander, not to get out the charcoals for a barbeque every time the sun peeks through the oppressive grey skies of the midlands, not to gather others around your adorable camping bonfire, and most importantly, keep your moralistic rants to yourself \u2014 you\u2019re doing things to my blood pressure no Marlboro red could ever fix.</p><p>Oh, but I hear you say, don\u2019t you realise how much you dirty smokers cost the NHS? \u00a32 billion every year. Why should my tax money be spent scraping tar from the lungs of people who have forced their illness upon themselves? Why don\u2019t smokers pay their own way?</p><blockquote class=\"alignright\"><p>Smokers pour a cool \u00a312.3bn into government coffers.</p></blockquote><p>Well, kindly, they do. Between \u00a39.7 billion generated in excise duty, and \u00a32.6 billion generated in VAT, smokers pour a cool \u00a312.3 billion into government coffers. You know what that makes us? Public servants! People to be loved, not loathed \u2014 kissed, not killed \u2014 respected, not resented. Smokers should be sacrificial Gods amongst men, not spurned and despised! Consequently, I could politely rephrase the question; why should my tax take be spent funding your sorry arse after you call 999 every time a bad kebab gives you the shits?</p><blockquote class=\"alignleft\"><p>I\u2019ll ignore your unethical consumption if you ignore mine.</p></blockquote><p>How about a serious target, the corporate monsters that provide the cigarettes. The tobacco companies have been (justly) accused of everything from forcing children to work in the fields, suppressing scientific publications, casting their undue influence on democratic giants, targeting children where regulations are looser, and treating their low down workers like living machines. I shan\u2019t dodge the matter, big tobacco is a detestable industry. Yet before you scroll down to comment your moral victory, I could bring to light one defensive example. The IPhone in your pocket has a string of dirty secrets: the coltan in its processor is almost certainly sourced from mines in the remote east of the Democratic Republic of the Congo \u2013 where young children toil in mines for 12 hours daily, all to finance the mine owning warlords in their programme of extortion, rape, and murder, as they jostle amongst themselves for control a considerable chunk of the war torn nation. This blood stained coltan is then shipped north to the industrial nowhere of central China, where the monotony of assembly has driven so many of the emaciated quasi-slaves to try and end it all that the Apple factories have resorted to erecting suicide nets. Apple may well be the richest company in the world, but life is ugly at the bottom of the ladder. What point am I trying to prove? That in the game of post-modern\u00a0Capitalism, nearly every product has a dirty past. Unless you\u2019re truly going to stand up and fight the system, what do you say we make a truce? I\u2019ll ignore your unethical consumption if you ignore mine? If not an outright victory, we can at least call that point a draw.</p><blockquote class=\"alignright\"><p>Without the taxes, you could smoke a pack a day and not meet the cost of a lump of tofu.</p></blockquote><p>Which leaves but one more point that to my mind I must rebut. The cost of smoking. There\u2019s no dancing around the point that in the UK, dragging on the tangy haze of tobacco is conducive to both a sore throat and an empty wallet. When pushed for money, are there not far more fruitful products to drain your savings into? Yet I throw the burden of explanation here back to society at large. That is because smoking is not expensive, but the tax is. A pack would be \u00a32-\u00a34 were it not for the more-than-a-little on the side that works its way to Osbourne. Without tax, you could smoke a pack per day and not meet the cost of a lump of tofu. Were society not to overplay the externalities of smoking, as well as force smokers into a life of liminality, then the regime wouldn\u2019t come at such a cost. The problem is entirely contingent, not necessary \u2014 come the revolution in society\u2019s smoking sentiments, such an issue will be shown vacuous.</p><p>We arrive then at the point in this article where I question the purpose of my argument. To create a new wave of smoking recruits? God no, whilst I wouldn\u2019t be sorry for the added company on smoking excursions, it\u2019s not my place to tell you what to do. Rather my hope is to make you reassess your attitudes on the group that society has conditioned you to fear and despise, and perhaps even garner an emotion of respect for smokers, not the crazed amalgam of terror and pity that presently exists.</p><p>As it stands, the grid is now closing up. The careerists, the swotters, and last-minute slackers alike pack up their books and prepare to make the march back. Ready to endure the cycle once more tomorrow. As for me, I\u2019m off to colour the night air with enigmatic clouds of tobacco.</p>",

    "body": "<p>A couple of days after the <em>Hoar</em> launched, the <em>Boar</em>\u00a0released an update to its website.\u00a0I\u00a0tracked down an actual web designer and\u00a0we chatted about it on Facebook.</p><p><strong>Q:</strong>\u00a0What do you think of it?</p><p><strong>A:</strong>\u00a0It\u2019s a big improvement. It works on mobile devices, which probably account for about half of their views \u2014 so that\u2019s important. Structurally, it\u2019s a very strong base. It still makes me cringe a bit though.</p><p><strong>Q:</strong> Could you tell me a bit about yourself?</p><p><strong>A:</strong> I\u2019m a Warwick student with about six years of web design and graphic design under my belt. I liked the idea behind the new Uni logo last year. I\u2019ve done work for a bunch of societies at Warwick, but I freelance properly when I have time.</p><p><strong>Q:</strong> So what do you commend about the <em>Boar\u2019s</em> new presence?</p><p><strong>A:</strong>\u00a0Like I said, being responsive [suitable for different screen sizes] is very important. The main navigation menu is a nice touch.\u00a0The design seems to be their own work, not something derivative, which is nice too. The headlines look good in PT Serif \u2014 it\u2019s a neat allusion to their print edition. Also, it\u2019s\u00a0very similar\u00a0to the Guardian\u2019s custom headline type. It\u2019s a really big improvement.</p><p><strong>Q:</strong> What would you do differently?</p><p><strong>A:</strong> I think I\u2019ve got three important criticisms.</p><p><strong>Q:</strong> Do you want to take us through them one by one?</p><p><strong>A:</strong>\u00a0Sure. First, the design is very image reliant. That\u2019s not a bad thing in a magazine, where every article comes with its own, directly relevant and (hopefully) visually interesting photography. Newspapers have it harder. A story like the one leading today, about arts students\u2019 grades,\u00a0will never come with a very helpful image.</p><p>Finding some suitable stock image probably makes the article more interesting, and it\u2019s really helpful for Facebook shares, but I wouldn\u2019t have given those photos such prominence on the website. A lot of them are pretty crappy.</p><p><strong>Q:</strong> So what? You\u2019d make them smaller?</p><p><strong>A:</strong> Yeah. Mainly on the homepage \u2014 they\u00a0layered almost all the text over images. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s necessary.</p><p><strong>Q:</strong> Ok, next?</p><p><strong>A:</strong> I\u2019m a typeface obsessive\u2026</p><p><strong>Q:</strong> Fonts?</p><p><strong>A:</strong> Yeah, fonts. I like both of their choices.\u00a0Headings are in PT Serif, paragraphs and meta are in Karla. They don\u2019t work insanely well\u00a0together, but they\u2019re both available for free, which is a big thing when you consider that a type family can easily cost over \u00a3600, or a hefty monthly subscription if you want to use them online. I think it\u2019s a good compromise.</p><p></p><img class=\"alignnone size-medium_large wp-image-539\" src=\"https://thehoar.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/typefaces-768x383.png\" alt=\"typefaces\" width=\"768\" height=\"383\" srcset=\"https://thehoar.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/typefaces-768x383.png 768w,https://thehoar.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/typefaces-300x149.png 300w,https://thehoar.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/typefaces-1024x510.png 1024w,https://thehoar.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/typefaces-192x96.png 192w,https://thehoar.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/typefaces.png 1754w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\"><p>The<em> Hoar</em> uses Karla too.

    "body": "<p>The hardest part is breaking the ice and introducing yourself to a graduate employer recruiter, beginning the process of earning your father\u2019s adoration. To make it easier, we\u2019ve compiled a list of tips to make that lasting first impression.</p><h3>1. Smile</h3><p>Show the representative your teeth. Don\u2019t tell them about the work you put into maintaining their gleaming glory \u2014 flossing and brushing twice a day and swilling with mouthwash before bed \u2014 let your teeth do the talking for you. A clean smile signals that you\u2019re capable of planning for the future. Also, your dad paid for those teeth to get straightened, so you better believe that when you finally tell him you landed that dream job that you can attribute it to his investment in your teeth. He\u2019ll love that. And maybe then love you.</p><h3>2. Firm handshake</h3><p>Grab their hand firmly while maintaining eye contact. But not too firmly. A handshake too firm is uncomfortable and will make the recruiter recoil. This will drastically reduce the chances of you ever having a firm embrace with the man you missed throughout your entire childhood.</p><h3>3. Ask them questions about their life</h3><p>Let\u2019s face it: people like to talk about themselves. A graduate employer recruiter was once a student like you, unsure about their future career. Hell, they probably still aren\u2019t sure about their career, but they\u2019re stuck in it now. Ask them about their life as a student, when things were much simpler. Ask them about their first serious relationship. Ask them about their relationship with their father. Have a serious heart to heart with the person who holds the key to your father\u2019s love.</p><h3>4. Scream \u2018WHY DIDN\u2019T YOU LOVE ME ENOUGH TO COME TO MY CRICKET MATCHES?!\u2019 repeatedly</h3><p>This signals to potential employers that you have an elephant\u2019s memory and a critical mind. It also lets them know what you value: affection from a man who did not want to have a relationship with you, because you were not good enough. Explain to the campus recruiter that you aren\u2019t good enough at cricket to do it professionally and that your father doesn\u2019t value it, so that whatever graduate scheme they have available is probably a better fit.</p><h3>5. Beg</h3><p>If all else fails, get down on your knees and beg. Tell them you\u2019re willing to stay at the office until 2am, bring coffee to whoever asks, and forego any shred of individuality and character to fit the corporate mould. Tell them that you\u2019ll even do the work for free \u2014 so long as you can tell your estranged father that you\u2019re doing something \u2018important\u2019 with your life. Jokingly ask them if they\u2019ll be your dad instead, but secretly mean it.</p><p>We hope this list helps you gain the affection of the man who accidentally had you and has regretted it for the rest of his life. A man who would rather not speak to you because it would involve admitting fault of his own. Good luck!</p>",

So it would be were it not the case that each iterative march from the overpriced and under stocked Janus face of a scarcely changed Costcutter through to the humming fans of the book-filled tomb for tomes that is Warwick library \u2014 short of an arduous detour, one must file past the grating hum of the brutilalist monstrosity that is the Koan.</p><p>There and then the flood gates open, my mind is cast straight back to the barren concrete abyss of the post-war reconstruction era. Raised on stories of the oppressive cruelty of Romania\u2019s psychotic past dictator, Ceausescu, the historic wound of my people\u2019s suffering is re-opened \u2014 and thrown to the foyer of my being. For brutalism is the architecture of choice for European Communism (disclaimer: when the author uses the term Communism, she refers to the oppressive Soviet Statism of the 20th century, she is aware that the term can be misleading) \u2014 and hence monuments of its ilk represent values and events that today we find abhorrent. It\u2019d wouldn\u2019t be such an issue if the university showed some damn sensitivity, but to cast it brashly at the heart of campus, without so much as a distressing content warning sign? It\u2019s absurd.</p><hr><p>Why do I care so much? Well, not only is exposure to such sources of deep seated psychological trauma disquieting to a very particular group on campus (better to let the trauma fester undisturbed, that fits with the psychoanalytic canon, no?), but it also sends an unsettling message \u2014 the message that, in embracing Soviet style architecture, we turn a blind eye to the historical outrages ideologically tied to the symbol. We are unperturbed that this symbol represents values that we\u2019d elsewhere condemn, say, the manufactured starvation of five million Ukrainians for the pure aim of forcing submission to Moscow. What\u2019s more, in letting these values be tolerated, we are allowing the leaders of tomorrow to accept and be influenced by the (now 100% refuted) values of the past. Perish the thought of how many fresh faced adolescents have looked to the Koan and thought \u2014 \u201cwow, what a masterpiece \u2014 brutalism is great \u2014 let\u2019s grab some books on its history and\u2026 wow, the Soviet union was gr8, m8\u201d.</p><p>We should judge history by today\u2019s enlightened standards, if we don\u2019t, who else will. And it is only in destroying any relic from the past that in any small way triggers inter temporal mental wounds, can we shield ourselves from the reality that the world isn\u2019t always pleasant \u2014 and what\u2019s more, in cutting out all opposing viewpoints we can finally entrench the social and moral truth claims of today\u2019s discourse; be it from demolishing the slave built federal buildings of Washington (i.e. The White House)\u00a0right through to blanking out the biblical justification for the genocide of the Amalekites (1 Samuel 15:2-3, relevant even if there are no longer any Amalekites left to be offended, it only proves that the Israelites didn\u2019t go halves when it came to genocide). We can form a new world, and by God it\u2019ll be brave.</p><p>Okay okay, I\u2019ll tie up a historical loose end; brutalism and Stalinist architecture weren\u2019t technically the same thing. But the differences are broadly geographical \u2014 aesthetically (less is more, not bore) and principally (maximal building for minimum cost), it is scarcely possible to discriminate between the two.</p><p>Back to the argument:</p><p>Sure, Brutalism may have had some, or even mostly, good outcomes; housing the post war poor, reconstructing bombed out cities at a low cost etc etc <em>yawn</em>. But this totally ignores the importance of the myth of pure evil. We cannot have balanced villains, we need it all to be binary, for fear that if people see the fact that, for example, Al Capone funded soup kitchens, they might not hate him entirely, and then where would that leave us? Having to discuss things, and find balance? I\u2019ll be damned, we have the answers to right and wrong, now is just a game of steamrolling the wrongs.</p><hr><p>In conclusion, leaving the Koan standing tolerates the undesirable aspects of a bygone epoch. Leaving the Koan standing ignores the suffering of Gulags, the arbitrary political violence, and the hard times some of us missed by a mere generation. Finally, leaving the Koan standing fails to quash the risk of Warwick creating the next generation of maniacal despots. So tear down the Koan \u2014 and take down half of library road while you\u00a0are at it.</p><p>Though my critique is not merely destructive. Warwick needs a monument for our age, we need to leave a legacy that hopefully a future generation can tear down. I suggest a statue dedicated to the iPhone. Not only does this capture the soulless corporatism, under the verisimilitude of chic culture, prevalent on Campus today \u2014 but it also showcases an article of moral callousness that our generation chooses to ignore.

Seriously, art shouldn\u2019t be about tourist revenue \u2014 how about getting an artist for our age to create something to celebrate Greece, you know,\u00a0<em>today</em>.</p><p>For once I\u2019m inclined to argue that #Rhodesmustfall, but that\u2019s another debate in itself.</p><blockquote class=\"aligncenter\"><p>Good and bad, I defined these words, quite clear, no doubt, somehow,<br>\nBut I was so much older then,<br>\nI\u2019m younger than that now<br><small>Bob Dylan</small></p></blockquote><p><small>(Main image <a href=\"https://flic.kr/p/BTWpJd\">via</a>)</small></p>",

Its not you, it\u2019s me.</p><p>Alas, housemate selection is a shotgun marriage, and a large part of the bugger of it all is the metaphorical wine and catering: which house are you going to rent? Who are you going to rent it with?</p><p>There are a lot of potential houses and a lot of potential housemates. In a bid to avoid putting it too bluntly, it\u2019s all a bit difficult.</p><p>Worry not. Old mother <em>Hoar</em> has put her collective heads in a small room with some vodka\u00a0and constructed an essential seven-point checklist to see you into a pleasant house that\u2019s adequately stocked with pleasant people.</p><p>No, honestly, it\u2019s a pleasure.</p><h2>1. Live in Leam</h2><p>I apologise if this is an overly prosaic or <em>Tab</em>-like observation, but it\u2019s feckin\u2019 stupid to not live in Leamington. You may not devote your Fridays to Neon, your Thursdays to Smack and your every waking hour to Kelseys, but the town has other draws.</p><p>For one thing, it\u2019s where all the other students are. Social interaction is scientifically proven to be good for you. So that\u2019s a plus.</p><p>For another, it\u2019s actually rather nice. In a way Canley can never hope to be. If you grew up in Milton Keynes and can\u2019t understand what I\u2019m talking about, just take my word for it.</p><p>Perhaps most importantly, it\u2019s an extremely long way from campus. This is an administrative fuckup they ought to sort out. All the same, you didn\u2019t do Warwick right if you didn\u2019t, at some point, have to set a 6:30 alarm for a 9am.</p><h2>2. Living with\u00a0your halls\u00a0folk\u00a0isn\u2019t a completely\u00a0terrible idea</h2><p>If you don\u2019t hate them all yet, something\u2019s going ok. Don\u2019t mess with shit that\u2019s not broken. You only get three years as an undergrad.</p><h2>3. Don\u2019t live in the arse end of No-Leam (or So-Leam)</h2><p>The aforementioned benefits of a Rootes-like proximity to your nearest and dearest are forfeited if you happen to select a\u00a0prim cul-de-sac full of seventy-somethings.</p><p>The church bus stop is your friend. Living more than five minutes from it will lead to good grades, toned calves and a solo drinking problem. We wouldn\u2019t want that.</p><h2>4. Choose a house based entirely on its\u00a0current residents</h2><p>Since people are generally pretty infallible, deferring to someone else\u2019s judgement can be, and often is, a jolly good idea. If they say words that broadly resemble,\u00a0\u2018this house is a load of shit, so we\u2019re moving out\u2019, consider it\u00a0a red light.</p><h2>5. Don\u2019t live with anyone\u00a0you plan to\u00a0share bodily fluids with</h2><p>Divvy up\u00a0thoughts, emotions, drink, blunts, eyeball shots or a kidney with any of your future housemates by all means. Draw the line at coital relations with anyone\u00a0you are contractually obliged to live with.</p><h2>6.\u00a0Avoid schedule makers</h2><p>Cleaning rotas are like a wet fart at an orgy. Should you find yourself in a group with someone with a\u00a0proclivity\u00a0for\u00a0melkishly messaging the house about cleaning\u00a0bathroom floors; leave the WhatsApp\u00a0group. Cut off contact. Burn your phone. Relocate to Indonesia.</p><p>While you\u2019re at it, avoid housemates who make liberal use of post-it lists and pass-agg comments about the milk.</p><h2>7. Women have a lot of hair</h2><p>This, of course, is no fault of their own. But if picking hair out of apparently every semi-aqueous interface in\u00a0the building (including, it seems, each\u00a0meal you eat) is something you don\u2019t eagerly anticipate, consider discussing\u00a0with future\u00a0female\u00a0housemates the possibility of shaving\u00a0their heads. A hairless house is a happy house.</p>",

Attempt at your own risk.</p><h1>Buy a DeLorean DMC-12</h1><p>(That\u2019s the car from Back to the Future, you cretin), then go back in time and maybe choose another university</p><h1>Snail Chariot</h1><p>Find a chariot.

This may take a while so take snacks, and maybe some lettuce for your noble steeds.</p><h1>Bus Pass</h1><p>Take the two hundred and eighty-two sodding pounds you spent on a bus pass and buy a one-way plane to a new life, far, far away from here.</p><h1>Willpower</h1><p>Harness the power of the old Gods and the new.

Reality, it seems, holds firm still in Warwick\u2019s bubble.</p><p>The rumble of building work had come to a close, yet the drone of the cranes had long since worked into the rhythm of my thoughts, adding a hum to my caffeinated walk. The rising mist is caught flat under the sharp sting of the twenty-four-hour lighting, animating yet obscuring the figures that discussed Modafinil beneath them. The tobacco haze of wanton cigarettes mingles with the air around the job-seekers, the deadline-chasers, and the probably-should-find-something-better-to-do-with-their-nighters. All of whom oblivious to the fact that Warwick, our Warwick, is yet to elect racially-charged orange-tinted opportunist. Neither has it witnessed the death of the neoliberal left, nor the rise of a reactionary right. Nothing is more extreme than the exclusion of the occasional aggressor with an unconventional opinion.</p><p>The changing world outside is neither brave nor new. Irony and satire have been relegated to a redundant force. The news gives us reality TV, and reality TV, the news. Yet despite all this, Warwick lingers on, great in its mediocrity, boundless in its boredom. The <em>Boar</em> keeps churning out the mundane comings and goings of campus life, and The Tab keeps documenting the comings of fictional penises. Students aspire to change their bank balances, not the world. And yet, this lingering hollow stench of flatulent facility breathes the anemic lifeblood into the heaving corpse of the university. The regularity of it all provides a welcome crutch in the post-Bowie era. Warwick is shit, but there is no need to make it great, for our greatness is found in our shitness, and long may it stay so.</p><p>Fuck you 2016, I\u2019m going for a smoke.</p>",

McDuckface then proceeded to create even more flooding using the kitchen sink, with the large mass of water in the pub eventually undermining the building\u2019s structural integrity and causing part of the ceiling to collapse.</p><p>Campus security and the police were able to apprehend Mr McDuckface and drive off the small birds, using tasers and CS gas, but the Duck had to be closed for several hours while the resulting flood damage was repaired.</p><p>We asked\u00a0Mr McDuckface what motivated him.</p><p>\u201cI was trying to turn the Dirty Duck from a symbol of human capitalist domination that appropriates the images of ducks as part of a system that oppresses ducks and their avian allies, such as geese, turning them into either ornaments or food objects, while banning them from the premises that bears their name and perpetuating negative stereotypes about their cleanliness (or sanity and ability to reason logically, in the case of that particularly offensive ale \u2018Mad Goose\u2019), into a reclaimed safe space where ducks and their allies can live free from human capitalist oppression.</p><p>\u201cNaturally, any safe space for ducks and allies must have water and be free from their human oppressors.\u201d</p><p>SU President Liam Driver released a statement on the incident.</p><p>\u201cFollowing today\u2019s incident in which those who self-identify as ducks and their allies were ruthlessly restrained with excessive force by campus security and the police, while engaged in a peaceful protest, Warwick SU has been alerted to the oppression that water birds face on campus and as such we are creating the new post of water bird liberation officer, with elections for the post to take place next week.</p><p>Upon hearing of the incident, Peter Propaganda, Warwick\u2019s director of press and policy, was sent to comment on behalf of the university\u2019s administration.</p><p>\u201cAnything in this article that reflects badly on the university is entirely untrue,\u201d he said. \u201cWater fowl are treated very fairly at Warwick. There are\u00a0fewer hate crimes against ducks than at any other university, and as such this protest was entirely unnecessary and caused an obscene amount of damage.</p><p>\u201cFurthermore, criticism of the amount of force used by campus security and the police is entirely unjustified, the police were forced to use their tasers and CS spray after a duck quacked at them in an aggressive manner. In this context, the university has been forced to get a court injunction banning all ducks from coming within five miles of campus.\u201d</p><p>Mr Propaganda finished, \u201cIn addition to this, the Dirty Duck is entirely structurally sound and ceiling collapses are a common result of floods, allegations that the university officials ordered that particular section of the ceiling to be loosened after they heard members of Warwick For Free Education like to sit in that spot are completely unfounded.\u201d</p>",

    "body": "<p>Warwick\u2019s a funny old fish. For one thing, it\u2019s not a fish. But it does have a lake, though there aren\u2019t any (many?) fish in it.</p><p>The <em>Hoar</em> is by no means a fish. It is, however, the only help you\u2019re going to get in the\u00a0difficult ordeal of faux freshers\u2019 fortnight \u2014 an ordeal so horrendous that simple questions like, \u2018Is that a fish?\u2019 become unexpectedly difficult to answer.</p><h3>1. Create a new false account\u00a0of your prior education, domestic life and general health for each new person you meet.</h3><p>On paper, it makes sense to work out broadly what one\u2019s\u00a0identity is and \u2014 on the whole \u2014 to stick with it and avoid confusing people. At uni, however, such\u00a0indolence will do you no favours.</p><p>At Warwick, rubbing \u2014 as one does \u2014 shoulders and genitalia with the intellectual Ford Galaxies of the planet, possessing\u00a0any fewer than twelve\u00a0or thirteen different backstories will mark you out as a dangerous idiot.</p><p>In my first term, I explained to my personal\u00a0tutor that I was an elderly prostitute from Bogot\u00e1; to my flatmates that I was a roofer from Basildon, and to my parents that I was a communist agitator from Beirut.</p><h3>2. On no account permit yourself to partake of alcoholic drinks.</h3><p>As the Baby Jesus once wrote, \u2018vodka turns middle-class kids into silly twats\u2019. Silly twattery is punished at Warwick with large fines of which payment is not\u00a0required. (We don\u2019t know why either.)</p><p>To avoid charges of silly twattery, we recommend that young and old alike develop a healthy dependency upon narcotics. Heroin is a readily available opiate that can be easily administered by intravenous injection.</p><h3>3. Bring a small goat or sheep to keep your cleaner happy.</h3><p>Halls kitchens are cleaned once or twice a week by an overwhelmingly female army of not wholly horrible and generally charming cleaners. When forced\u00a0to clean kitchens that are not already clean, cleaners\u00a0invariably\u00a0become unhappy and frequently\u00a0become quite angry.</p><p>Intoxicated\u00a0cooks tend to attach\u00a0a decent\u00a0portion of their\u00a0comestibles to the fabric of the kitchen.\u00a0Therein lies the problem.</p><p>Even a very small goat or sheep will deliver enough goodness and cheer to delight\u00a0your cleaner, and serves the double function of converting waste organic matter into compact dung pellets. A happy cleaner, as we all know, is a good thing.</p><h3>4.\u00a0Do not shower alone.</h3><p>It is a well-reported matter of the utmost facthood that all dropouts decide to drop out whilst showering. Typically, this is because a potential dropout in a shower is a potential dropout shielded from the comforting fingerings\u00a0of his or her close friends and recent acquaintances.</p><p>Comforting fingerings from close friends and recent acquaintances are essential to healthy studenthood, so make a concerted effort to join any\u00a0close friend\u00a0or\u00a0recent acquaintance who appears to have secluded him- or herself in a solo shower.</p><h3>5. Do not attend lectures that you are not expected to attend.</h3><p>It is terribly tempting, once one discovers that Warwick on a weekday is a mass of concomitant lectures, to attempt\u00a0to attend all of them in their entirety.</p><p>This is an unrealistic goal.</p><h3>6. Develop an excellent joke\u00a0based upon the similar sounds of \u2018budget\u2019 and \u2018budge it\u2019. Use this excellent joke\u00a0to excuse yourself from\u00a0all budgetary problems.</h3><p>Near-homophones\u00a0are powerful like that.</p><h3>7. Join two societies so that you can advertise mad cool super discount genuine Ray-Bans in their Facebook groups.</h3><p>The mad cool super discount genuine Ray-Ban boom doesn\u2019t look like it\u2019s slowing down, so get in on it.</p>",

Consider this instead a string of timely, yet unrequested, meditations on one person\u2019s path into the academic unknown.</p><h3><strong>Freshers\u2019 week.\u00a0</strong></h3><blockquote class=\"alignright\"><p>People who think\u00a0reality won\u2019t hit\u00a0ground their beliefs in haphazard stories of sharing a spliff with a trust-fund hippie in a hostel.</p></blockquote><p>As a starry-eyed infant, the world around you is a dream hazy with smiling carers, loving helpers, and sensical systems built on adoration and trust. Man is born free, yet then begins to read newspapers. Eventually, the reality dawns that the world is a place that is neither simple\u00a0nor particularly pleasant.</p><p>People who tell you otherwise ground their beliefs in haphazard stories of sharing a spliff with a trust-fund hippie in a hostel \u2014 they have never been chased down a back alley in Bogot\u00e1 at four in the morning\u00a0by a crackhead wielding a metal pipe. Indeed, the world is full of pain and injustice \u2014 children mine the Coltan in your iPhone, racism still holds people back in the job market, and Warwick doesn\u2019t have a proper freshers\u2019 week. You get the idea. The lecture-filled integration-averse freshers \u2018experience\u2019 is by no means the only injustice on campus; the class divide in university accommodation and the patent sexism by club bouncers both spring to mind; yet it is by far the most perverse.</p><blockquote class=\"alignright\"><p>Devoid of a true freshers\u2019 week, Warwick\u2019s lucky freshers will encounter a week of 9am lectures.</p></blockquote><p>As such, whereas most human-centred universities will create a full timetable of adorable cultish meet and greet events \u2014 Warwick\u2019s lucky freshers will encounter a nine\u00a0AM\u00a0<em>Sub-national feminism in no particular context</em> module following a questionably-noticeable night out at Coventry\u2019s famous down-at-heel club, <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/coventrykasbah/\" target=\"_blank\">Kasbah</a>.</p><p>Short of the occasional canap\u00e9 and \u2018networking\u2019 event that may arise, the main crowd of people you will encounter are the ramshackle collection of students that fill your halls. If, like me, you get very lucky in said halls, this is no bad thing: you can fill the hours between introductory lectures recounting uninteresting stories about your life whilst awaiting the ritual of playing the three drinking games that you collectively know. If, on the other hand, you find yourself at the arse-end of campus with a group of lock-ins \u2014 heaven help you, go out and find an interesting group before it is too late.</p><p>Should you have the time and volition to read this entire piece, likely you will be looking for things to do to fill the spaceless hours that nobody told you would exist in amongst the supposed alcoholic haze of the first few weeks of university. You may be disappointed to find a distinct lack of drug-fuelled art parties, or for that matter, anything to do in the daytime.</p><blockquote class=\"alignright\"><p>This is called drinking to forget how\u00a0<em>boring</em>\u00a0you are.</p></blockquote><p>Yet fear not, I have two solutions. Firstly \u2014\u00a0university needn\u2019t be a permanent state of catatonic bliss \u2014 that is only something that happens abroad \u2014 instead, it\u2019s quite alright to be bored, just don\u2019t vegetate. As that first point sounds too much like self-help, the other piece of advice is to throw enough substances in your body that any natural aversion you have towards\u00a0finding yourself in novel situations disappears. In university, this is called drinking to forget how <em>boring</em> you are. Everyone does it, and so should you, unless you become a dickhead when you\u2019re drunk.</p><p>A healthy dose of post-lunch beverages can make the difference between an afternoon of YouTube bingeing BB King concerts, and sleeping with a smoking hot Serbian after semi-sober pseudo-philosophising through regurgitating the five interesting mindful meditations you can conjure, as if from a sub-par cut-scene in Linklater\u2019s <em>Before Sunrise</em>.</p><p>Moreover, the recalcitrance that a pre-alcohol iteration of yourself may have towards drifting from questionable situation to questionable situation can, with a touch of conscious effort, disappear \u2014\u00a0allowing you to perhaps eventually live in the surreal drift of surroundings that you dreamt university would entail.</p><blockquote class=\"alignleft\"><p>People, surprisingly, are more effervescent in their first few days; generally, this will mean that their natural shitness will eventually shine through</p></blockquote><p>Naturally, of what can be considered a freshers\u2019 experience, the few people you find are of focal importance. Everyone is different, and so there is no point in setting out any generic comments \u2014\u00a0except perhaps the need to remember that all of these people (including that guy who did a gap year), are likely just as lost and boring as you are. People, surprisingly, are more effervescent in their first few days; generally, this will mean that their natural shitness will eventually shine through. However, use the brief intermittent period to throw a net that is as extensive as possible in lieu of contacts \u2014 so that you may catch the occasional gem.</p><p>God, if I could hear myself now\u2026 If you don\u2019t know how to make friends and have fun, then by God don\u2019t look to\u00a0the<em> Hoar\u00a0</em>for actual help. Perhaps it\u2019s time to touch much more pertinent matters; say, the inevitable hours you will spend gyrating to thoroughly average mainstream music mash-ups in thoroughly <a href=\"https://www.warwicksu.com/events/\" target=\"_blank\">average</a> <a href=\"http://tryneon.co.uk\" target=\"_blank\">mainstream</a> <a href=\"http://www.trysmack.co.uk\" target=\"_blank\">clubs</a>.</p><blockquote class=\"alignleft\"><p>You\u2019ll find suggestive headline nights and naughty words written on walls.</p></blockquote><p>In those vague periods between trying to negotiate four different (entirely unannounced) bureaucratic streams, you will inevitably find yourself falling into body-odour heaving overheated rooms, wherein you\u2019ll find suggestive headline nights and naughty words written on walls (which attempt to serve the same purpose as viagra in retirement homes, or slow jazz in the Edinburgh Zoo panda enclosure). Whilst the freshers\u2019 period will probably not be your first introduction to the nightclub scene (unless you really are a dull fucker), it will seem as though it is the most pivotal patch of partying you will have experienced.</p><p>To don a word from the not-so-wise \u2014\u00a0tolerating the same old shit a few dozen times is a necessary evil in forging conviviality. One-off niche techno nights in the <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/Zephyrlounge/\" target=\"_blank\">Zephyr Lounge</a> can wait until you\u2019ve found your feet. Moreover, as you are reminded for the fifth time in one night that \u2018uptown funk gonna give it to you\u2019, you may enjoy the artistic existential dread that repetitive empty nights can furnish you with; if nothing else, reflecting on the whole ordeal gives you a great deal of material to discuss with the fly-by-night friends you\u2019ll make in the smoking area.</p><blockquote class=\"alignright\"><p>To quote the Soviet defence minister on the downing of a spy plane, \u201cdon\u2019t shit where you eat\u201d.</p></blockquote><p>As for the matter of meeting people in clubs, a few hard and fast rules arise: to quote the Soviet defence minister on the downing of a spy plane, \u201cdon\u2019t shit where you eat\u201d almost goes without saying, but for at least the first few months, your flatmates are romantically out-of-bounds. The same goes for simply spending time in clubs with your peers from halls, don\u2019t cling to them for safety, you have a whole year with those fuckers, meet and greet while people are for once vaguely open; and by the starry heavens above us, and the historical dialectic beneath us, don\u2019t fall in love \u2014\u00a0especially if you are a fresher fresh in the realm of singularity.</p><p>By now you likely regret indulging in freshers\u2019 tickets, and so you should. Just because you spent five British pounds on a ticket to the misleadingly named \u2018Flirt\u2019 night, be prepared to drop such preparations in a heartbeat. Go, as it were, where the spirit takes you. Follow that Finnish flame from finance classes as she invites you some godawful night in Leamington,. Joke with everyone she introduces you to, and grin and bear the reality of the homogeneity of nights out in the Midlands.</p><h3>Societies</h3><p>The mark of a good writer is the ability to condense a sentiment, behind which lies years of wisdom, into a handful of lines. Fittingly, this piece has covered two main points in well over\u00a0a\u00a0thousand words. As such, to quote the <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/january/17/newsid_2530000/2530413.stm\" target=\"_blank\">last words</a> of Gary Gilmore as he faced the firing squad, let\u2019s bloody well get this over with.</p><blockquote class=\"alignright\"><p>The majority of societies reflect the unavoidable facets of one\u2019s self, such as nationality or degree subject.</p></blockquote><p>Societies are something of a badge of honour to universities; every university claims to have the greatest and most diverse selection of societies, and Warwick is no exception. However, most societies follow a fairly predictable hue, and, consequently, a \u2018diverse range\u2019 of societies isn\u2019t all too valuable an asset, especially when it appears that the vast majority of said societies reflect a kind of shit union based on unavoidable facets of one\u2019s self, such as nationality or degree subject.</p><p>Indeed, the societies committee often appears too busy creating new geographical super- and sub-regions for which to grant a separatist identity that funding is never extended to innovative interest expanding groups \u2014\u00a0such as the short-lived <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/DocSocWarwick/\" target=\"_blank\">DocSoc</a> movement (a group devoted to fusing documentary and rave cultures, RIP). As you may have guessed,\u00a0the\u00a0<em>Hoar\u00a0</em>is not a society. Hence we are permitted the freedom to criticise whomever we so please \u2014\u00a0unbeholden to any interests but those\u00a0of\u00a0our oft-hungover writers.</p><blockquote class=\"alignleft\"><p>You are not Hungarian and the \u00a34\u00a0membership fee for Wine and Whiskey Society is not\u00a0justified.</p></blockquote><p>Don\u2019t, therefore, make the age-old mistake of buying societies federation membership and joining every society from Mauritian to Mauritanian\u00a0\u2014\u00a0you are not culturally Hungarian and the four-pound membership fee for Wine and Whiskey Society will never be justified. Regardless of what their representatives say, you have absolutely no need for\u00a0a membership to try a couple of sessions and get the measure of the matter. Indeed, many members of the Debating Cult never appear to even join their own society, but somehow get subsidised travel around Europe to their strange affairs.</p><p>Moreover, splashing out on a variety of different memberships isn\u2019t worthwhile when it comes to distributing one\u2019s time. To properly experience a\u00a0society, one\u00a0must devote to it a great deal of effort. Unless one is\u00a0one of the horrible people for whom multiple society memberships mean multiple opportunities to enter a clientelist executive committee and hence bolster your CV, one\u00a0will not profit from wasting ones\u00a0afternoons half-arseing a series of interests.</p><p>It would be unfair to impress upon the the reader\u00a0that all societies are vacuous affairs for self-advancement; some are notably not shit. Surprisingly, not everything in Warwick happens to be shit, and hence the next section will be devoted to the collection of rare pleasures that can be found, and where one may find them.</p><blockquote class=\"alignright\"><p>Always follow the spirit of a conversation if a conversation is fuelled by spirits.</p></blockquote><p>Finally, perhaps the most valuable nugget of advice from this section: always follow the spirit of a conversation if a conversation is fuelled by spirits. Don\u2019t waver in acting on the suggestion of a drunken conversation, especially when it comes to creative matters.\u00a0The <em>Hoar</em> wouldn\u2019t exist if it hadn\u2019t been for a drunken night at Robbins Well (which, even more fittingly, has since <a href=\"https://theboar.org/2016/04/robins-well-leamington-shut/\">closed</a> \u2014 Ed). If a well-lubricated conversation heads you in the direction\u00a0of a new society or interest group, by all means follow it up and do the damn thing yourselves. The reward will be notably more valuable to you that way, as you\u2019ll see a small chunk of campus society, and indeed your own life, as a reflection of your volition, aspirations, and effort. How cute.</p><h3><strong>Things that aren\u2019t shit\u00a0</strong></h3><blockquote class=\"alignright\"><p>Warwick Radio is remarkably not shit.</p></blockquote><p>Hearing your voice boom back to you in a radio studio touches a corner of life\u2019s pleasure that escapes words. So too does knowing that the three people listening to you live likely couldn\u2019t give a shit for the great lengths you go to in describing pre-coup Chilean music. Yet more than just a fun excuse to justify an eccentric music taste \u2014 <a href=\"http://www.radio.warwick.ac.uk\">Warwick Radio</a> is remarkably not shit. You can meet the few people who\u2019ll want to attend a club night \u00a0that\u2019s slightly different, or help organise open mic nights that value creativity. Indeed, you may even find yourself trying your hand at music and poetry, which can be an infinite source of enjoyment.</p><p>Another positive avenue is writing; you could always <a href=\"https://thehoar.org/register/\">join the </a><em>Hoar.</em>\u00a0We\u2019re constantly looking for \u2018against the grain\u2019 writers with a taste for punk satire, you need only submit an article through our website, and, if we like it, we\u2019ll try and make you a permanent fixture. Note that our articles are uncredited, so as to avoid the lacklustre step-up journalism that seems to permeate into so much campus writing. Furthermore, you can\u2019t even put our name on a respectable CV.</p><blockquote class=\"alignleft\"><p>The <em>Tab</em> has\u00a0commitment to sensationalism, the <em>Boar</em> to the truth, the <em>Panoptic</em> to being thoroughly interesting, and we to the rest.</p></blockquote><p>Writing on campus can be bland at times: the\u00a0<em><a href=\"http://thetab.com/uk/warwick/\">Tab</a>\u00a0has</em>\u00a0a commitment to gross sensationalism, and the\u00a0<a href=\"https://theboar.org\"><em>Boar</em></a>\u00a0has a commitment to the truth (or\u00a0actually reporting the comings and goings of campus life, which can be remarkably boring).\u00a0Needless, there are a number of interesting avenues to follow. One that has spurred my\u00a0interest of late is the nascent\u00a0<a href=\"https://thepanoptic.co.uk\"><em>Panoptic</em></a>, in which almost any subject matter is open to write\u00a0about \u2014 and is all presented in a neat format with a genuine commitment to quality.</p><p>However, not everyone who arrives at Warwick has an interest in music or writing, and there is little I\u2019d be qualified to spell out on other such matters, instead my\u00a0focus will shift to more general matters that aren\u2019t shit. For the sake of brevity, only two will be touched upon; cosmopolitanism and coffee shops.</p><p>Warwick is, on\u00a0most counts, a thoroughly international university. Save the small-minded suitor of atavism, this is rather fantastic. Firstly, international students provide more than just a ready bank of potential holiday locations, they\u2019ve had the pleasure of leading a thoroughly different childhood to yourself. Many still manage to be entirely boring, but there\u2019s\u00a0a\u00a0commensurate bunch\u00a0who, through good old cultural exchange, have a bounty to give: their different experiences\u00a0allow\u00a0you to grow your own.</p><p>For fear of sounding overly sentimental (Brexit has left me in a state of extreme sensitivity), we\u2019ll move on to the flipside of Warwick\u2019s international flavour:\u00a0exchange programmes. As I write this monstrosity, I\u00a0sip local red wine in my apartment on\u00a0the sunny Proven\u00e7al climbs of Southern France. I don\u2019t mean to brag, but it\u2019s fucking lovely. It is imperative that you seize every opportunity to study abroad in whatever capacity is offered during your degree. Warwick genuinely provides a great deal to that end. The only parts of you that\u2019ll regret it are your wallet, liver and lungs.</p><blockquote class=\"alignright\"><p>For first years, a trip to Leamington involves\u00a0a journey on the bad-but-not-quite-as-bad-as-waterboarding U1 bus.</p></blockquote><p>As for coffee, given the thoroughly middle-class nature of Leamington Spa (until you\u00a0enter the abyss to the south [which has charms of its own]), a profusion\u00a0of independent coffee shops are to be found. These provide the ideal milieu for every kind of meeting, none more so than sharpening your teeth in quixotic discussions ranging from fantasy loves to fantasy league football. Whilst for first years, a trip to Leamington involves\u00a0a journey on the bad-but-not-quite-as-bad-as-waterboarding U1 bus, a day wherein an eleven AM\u00a0coffee meeting drifts onto a four AM\u00a0trawl through Brazilian\u00a0<em>bossa nova,\u00a0</em>is scarcely wasted, even when the looming dread of exams warrants that your time is\u00a0spent labouring under the rational hand of the library clock.</p><h3><strong>Sports\u00a0</strong></h3><p>If leaving your fee-paying, ivy-walled school and joining\u00a0university forces you to rub shoulder with too much riff-raff, then perhaps a sports society might\u00a0be for you. Alternatively, should you aspire to be a genuine sportsperson, they are something of a necessary step along the way.</p><p>However, should you not wish\u00a0to devote your life to a mono-gendered cult of action \u2014 being\u00a0barked at with drinking orders that have the same fascist\u00a0ferocity\u00a0as training drills \u2014 then, by all means, avoid them. Taking rugby as an example, you can witness the fraternal cult of tubby private school boys taking little regard for the enjoyment of alcohol as they set a series of manhood-proving drinking tests for one another, losing veritable days in their weeks to the m\u00e9lange of drinking and training. Then there is rowing, wherein narcissism is the closest thing an outsider will\u00a0see to a personality.\u00a0Not all sports societies are so intense, it should be added, there\u2019s a lot to be said for the non-professional ambitions of non-competitive sports \u2014 where, quite surprisingly, people can interact in some semblance of social conviviality.</p><h3>Studies</h3><p>If you remember nothing else, remember to never take study advice from the<em> Hoar.\u00a0</em>Beyond that; a vague commitment to attend lectures and seminars, a dose of sentience, dabbling in relevant literature, and a library dash in the final weeks should be all one really needs to secure a two-one. Unless you are intent upon pursuing\u00a0academia further, a two-one is more than sufficient \u2014 firsts are for people who floss. Add to that that first year doesn\u2019t count for many courses, and\u00a0it may be time for a drink.</p><blockquote class=\"alignright\"><p>If you remember nothing else, remember to never take study advice from the<em>\u00a0Hoar.\u00a0</em></p></blockquote><p>However, not only do you still need to pass but also it\u2019s well worth your while to go for a two-one, as it is usually a prerequisite to most options of studying abroad. Returning once again to the subject of studying abroad, it may be a fruitful experience attempting to pick up a language as one of your modules. By shaking off an adolescent recalcitrance to the great unknown in other languages, you\u2019ll perhaps found that there\u2019s a great deal to be gained from being able to assimilate more easily into other cultures \u2014 even if that only means assimilating yourself into the beds and bodies of foreign lovelies in Bluebell who may (or in some cases, may not) adore mumbled attempts to chat to them in their native tongue. However, don\u2019t, as one\u00a0<em>Hoar</em> did, attempt to pick up a language you have no attempt of learning, only to score a remarkable <sup>14</sup>\u2044<sub>100</sub> in that module.</p><h3>Housing</h3><p>Nowadays, it seems that everyone lives in some form of house. Given the importance of protecting yourself from the West Midlands sky, it may be worth spilling a couple of lines in the direction of housing.</p><blockquote class=\"alignleft\"><p>Never go\u00a0to Coventry. To be clear, don\u2019t go to Coventry.</p></blockquote><p>It should, within a couple of hours of arriving, go without saying that you absolutely need to escape halls as soon as is humanly possible. This should never mean going to Coventry, to be clear, don\u2019t go to Coventry; staple your balls to the floor of the Red Square if you must, but don\u2019t ever live in Coventry, Canley, or any other post-war equivalent. As a politics lecturer said to a room of four-hundred\u00a0students on our inaugural lecture \u2014 the Germans had the right idea.</p><p>That leaves Leamington or Kenilworth. Go to Kenilworth if you wish to be a middle-England aesthete. Go to Leamington if you wish to be a normal human being. Upon arriving in Leamington, you\u2019ll likely find it to be nowhere near the university. This is a technical fuckup that\u00a0is yet to\u00a0be addressed. However, it is the only place where any semblance of \u2018something\u2019 is ever happening.</p><blockquote class=\"alignright\"><p>Nothing breeds animosity like soggy shags.</p></blockquote><p>As for who to live with, if there is any hint that your potential housing partner is a list maker, ditch them at first instance. Life in a house is so much easier without some anal bastard reminding you of the dishes. It\u2019s probably unwise also to move in with your very best of friends. Love and hate are horns of the same beast, and hence you\u2019ll likely find disputes more likely to flare; that, or you\u2019re too much of a boring fucker to have an intense relation with anyone. It should be reminded that women have a lot of hair, which can make co-habitation difficult, however, don\u2019t let this get in the way of living in a fruitful mixed-gender house, or for that matter, being a woman.</p><p>As for coital relations, remember that walls are only so thick, and housemates\u2019 patience only so extensive. Nothing breeds animosity like hearing consecutive soggy shags at three AM\u00a0in the full knowledge that you are only six hours away from your next seminar. Nothing, that is, except the act of choosing housemates. This will inevitably be a clusterfuck shitshow of hall politics. A good way to avoid having an issue here, is to not be a twat, forge alliances early, and mercilessly evade the possibility of being the person that the hated member of your hall group eventually has to live with.</p><h3>Finance</h3><p>University costs a great deal of money. As it would appear that the powers-that-be have little interest in lightening the financial burden of studenthood, the issue of how to pay for the whole affair warrants a brief mention. There is, however, little to be said on funding your time here save for the advice that you have to either a) come from a wealthy family that will send you piles of cash in hessian sacks, or b) forfeit the internship that is supposed to be a worthwhile expenditure of your free time and get a summer job.</p><blockquote class=\"alignleft\"><p>Internships are\u00a0like chlamydia.</p></blockquote><p>On\u00a0the matter of internships, we can swiftly return to Warwick\u2019s other forte, careerism. So as to claw their way up university rankings, Warwick attempts to stuff their students onto every student programme the financial institutions of the city have to offer. As such, internships are\u00a0like chlamydia, but without the fun; everyone seems to get them, yet they make no discernible positive impact on the individual\u2019s lives.</p><p>Unless your childhood dream was to fill in spreadsheets so as to reorganise information that\u2019ll make a collection of idle individuals increasingly wealthy, then you should really consider jobs outside of the square mile. This is tantamount to heresy on campus.</p><p>If I could implore, or indeed inspire one sentiment amongst the minds of students, it is to resist the idea that \u2014 aged eighteen \u2014 you need to be a corporate man-child with a full idea of your aims, ambitions, and strategy. Rather, in my humble and often misplaced opinion, university should be a protected buffer of years as you transition from an institutionally raised child into an individual adult capable of cultivating your own differences from the population as a whole. As such, grant an audible <em>fuck you</em> to the endless stream of CV clinics, corporate presentations, and employability workshops. Now is a time for, it pains me to say it, creating yourself \u2014 not applying\u00a0to a starter programme at KPMG.</p><h3>Students\u2019 Union</h3><p>Driving down a Portuguese motorway with an old friend, we played a\u00a0wonderful game of comparison between\u00a0the role of student unions and their national body, the NSU, both now, and thirty years ago. Once upon a time, the students union represented the collective interests of students in order to act as a counter-power to both university management and, on a national scale, the government. Students generally aligned with their union, and as such, managed to resist augmentations in fees, along with securing benefits on campus \u2014 in Warwick, we owe the very existence of students\u2019 union buildings to a notably prolonged occupation.</p><blockquote class=\"alignright\"><p>Instead, we\u00a0<em>hoarishly\u00a0</em>complain about it until someone can be bothered to attempt to make a change.</p></blockquote><p>Whether the deterioration of this role was on the behalf of students, who may have drifted away from any consciousness of their predicament as vulnerable young new voters, so as to focus on their careers, leaving an increasingly isolated and absurd psuedo-punkish \u2018different\u2019-brigade to fulfil the role of student protest. Or whether it was the increasingly petty and absurd actions of SUs across the country, focusing more on taking relatively uncontroversial positions on global political issues (often, confusingly, marred by\u00a0tinges of anti-semitism) as a step up to a potential political career, rather than\u00a0<em>actually\u00a0</em>posing any meaningful resistance to legislative changes that affect a great deal of students by virtue of their <em>being</em> students (such as the abolition of the maintenance grant for poor students), that was the cause \u2014 doesn\u2019t much matter. What does matter is that we don\u2019t react to the increasingly petty absurdity of the SU by attempting to tear it down, but instead,\u00a0<em>hoarishly\u00a0</em>complain about it until someone can be bothered to attempt to make a change, and hence a meaningful union <em>for</em> students.</p><h3>Bloody hell, that\u2019s a lot said, now to close up</h3><p>Freshers, freshers, freshers of the world unite; let your hobbies be registered crimes, let your mind, wallet, liver and lungs step gluttonously down avenues not yet pursued. By God, try to be your own damn people; you have nothing to lose but the shackles of middle class anaemicness. You can sleep when you\u2019re dead.</p><p>I\u2019m approaching the bottom of my box of wine, and hence it is time to close this diatribe whilst I can still faintly make out the laptop screen. My fingers fumble to roll one last cigarette \u2014 and like a drunken elder cousin I rely you this; the consequences of your university years are, legally speaking, sparse. Yet they go a great way towards forging the adult you\u2019ll regret being in the future. As such, it\u2019s time to <em>carpe fucking diem,\u00a0</em>you\u2019ll never be faced with a better opportunity to know how it feels to be on your own, without a home, like a rolling stone.</p><p>Have a passable year.</p>",

I have an unflinching record of not attending management meetings, I\u2019ve been on every side of the debate, and I\u2019m not going anywhere soon.</p><h3>2. God, that\u2019s a touch intense, is it not a bit too careerist to run for everything?</h3><p>Not at all, vacuous positions are an integral part of the Warwick experience.</p><h3>3. Very well, what do you have going for you?</h3><p>Well, I\u2019m not a fascist.</p><h3>4. Right, you\u2019re running for an exec role with societies, what do think you\u2019ll bring to that position?</h3><p>When it comes to societies, re-opening nominations is a central tenet.</p><h3>5. That may well be the case, how about welfare?</h3><p>Welfare is important, I care about welfare, I propose more welfare for everyone, all the time. There should definitely be more of it and I will definitely deliver it by re-opening nominations. Well, that\u2019s fair, no?</p><h3>6. OK, how about development.</h3><p>Development is important, I care about development, I propose more development for everyone, all the time. There should definitely be more of it and I will definitely deliver it by re-opening nominations. Need I develop the point further?</p><h3>7. God no, I suppose I should add democracy?</h3><p>Democracy is all well and good, provided no one is allowed to intervene bar the people running the election. We\u2019re not here to change any votes, just re-open nominations</p><h3>8. That\u2019s quite enough of that. Do you worry that your hardline Libertarian stance intimidates some voters?</h3><p>You\u2019re thinking of Ron Paul.</p><h3>9. Bollocks, you\u2019re right, errm, what do you aspire to do?</h3><p>Re-open nominations.</p><h3>10. Right, fuck you, that\u2019s quite enough, interview over.</h3><p>No wait, have you considered re-opening nominations?</p><h3>11. No one gives a fuck about your shitty candidacy, why don\u2019t you just hurry up and take that grad post at KPMG?</h3><p>Vote RON.</p>",

You might not have heard of Warwick before coming to Warwick, but you are now at Warwick.

When you drink enough of it you start kissing your flatmates or calling your mum to tell her you\u2019re sorry for everything.</p><h2>Pull</h2><p>You will have never come across this word and will definitely not come across it once whilst at university or ever. No one knows what it means but it looks quite funny. If you drink lots of beer (see above) you might try and do this! If anyone tries to define it they are wrong! It can not be defined!</p><p>N.B. Also opposite of push.</p><h2>The Student Union</h2><p>If you don\u2019t already know what this is simply by reading the words and processing them in your brain, then university is probably not for you. The Student Union is the student\u2019s union. You literally did not need to read this to know what it is, but there it is regardless. Because who needs a reason to define loads of words!

    "body": "<p>Woah. Smack. Cool.</p><p>Trouble is, it ain\u2019t. Neither are Neon, Assembly, Moo, the rest, or even Kasbah. I mean it. It\u2019s just dull.</p><p>Let\u2019s take a step back and dissect a typical Warwick clubnight. Sometime around Tuesday afternoon, as the biting tedium of the week sets in, someone somewhere on a group chat posits the simple question: \u2018Kasbah Friday?\u2019</p><p>The \u2018yeah why nots\u2019 and the \u2018nah, meeting my granny on Sats\u2019 fly, flow and flounder in. Without question, some sleek, slimmed down body of friends and pretty-much-not-enemies acquiesce to give over a Friday evening, night and early Saturday to Kasbah\u2019s altar of cultural appropriation. (How many of us had to Google precisely what it was that The Clash were strumming\u00a0about in <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJ9r8LMU9bQ\">that\u00a0song</a>?)</p><p>I digress \u2014 the important bit is that, sometime around eight on that Friday evening, the bunch finds itself huddled on inadequate seating in someone\u2019s kitchen\u00a0or sitting room, cellar or airing cupboard, with an adequate quantity of cheap vodka and Carling.</p><p>A pint glass is set on a coffee table, circled by playing cards. The numbers between one and twenty-one are shrieked in confused excitement. If it\u2019s a really terrible evening, merry folk clumsily\u00a0claim not to have never done anal in the Copper Rooms.</p><p>It\u2019s either d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu, or it\u2019s just thoroughly familiar. All the same, there\u2019s nothing wrong with familiar. As a matter of fact, that\u2019s how marriage works.</p><p>Such warm ensconcement however, as you \u2014 dear reader \u2014 surely know, is\u00a0an entertainment\u00a0merely preliminary to the hip-thrusting, jaeger-bombing reality of the night.</p><p>Of course, the issues with obsessing over a clubnight in Coventry when you live half an hour away are both manifold and obvious: there\u2019s a fucking bus journey.</p><p>Bus journeys are satan\u2019s own work at the best of times, but become a deeply unpleasant beast\u00a0when riddled with weeping lasses\u00a0and chanting lads. The Uniexpress, whose capitalisation ought to upset everyone more, possesses both of those burdens in spades.</p><p>It also arrives to collect the almost-ossified Warwickians about an hour-and-a-half too early. It is almost inevitable that your target remains several fingers down the bottle \u2014 several cans down the case \u2014 at the point when the girl-who-loves-Smack-but-never-drinks-more-than-a-glass-and-a-half-and-never-takes-illegal-drugs declares that it\u2019s five minutes until leaving time.</p><p>Frankly, bugger. I like this sofa and I\u2019m enjoying my second bottle of wine. I\u2019ve started to laugh too much, but I normally laugh at nothing but the misfortune of others, so that\u2019s ok. I feel the need to urinate every ten minutes, but there\u2019s a lavatory next door and I\u2019m pissed enough to be quite content to re-emerge with unwashed hands. I want to stay.</p><p>I say as much, and am told to cheer the fuck up.</p><p>The bus driver appears to be on a bad crack trip. The attendant was clearly born for a career beating prisoners to death in one of the dodgier\u00a0South East\u00a0Asian jails. Together, they do their best to deny ticket holders their ten pounds\u2019 worth and still get lost on the way.</p><p>Queue jump tickets, for some administrative reason beyond such mortals as us, generally lead to a longer queue than we\u2019d otherwise be forced to stand in. Club bouncers are guaranteed to be lovely people, but act otherwise. Cloakrooms on such nights are quite exclusively for the dangerously ill or stupid.</p><p>The floor tends to be empty on arrival, which is nice. The only course of action is to plough on up to one of the bars, or \u2014 if there\u2019s some semblance of a head between your shoulders \u2014 the smoking area.</p><p>If the journey to Kasbah is satan\u2019s gift to Warwick-kind, Kasbah\u2019s\u00a0smoking area\u00a0is god\u2019s gift. Smokers aside, it possesses a bar, a ready source of burgers and more seating space than the rest of the club combined. It is heavenly, but a tad cold.</p><p>The main room, while scorchingly warm, is a cavern of pop music and dot matrix screens. Dot matrix screens, if you\u2019re as well-lubricated and short-sighted as I am, are little more than a bewildering swizzle of moving lights. The main event, of course, is the heaving majority of gyrating, bottling Cov kids. They are neither pretty nor pleasant. Indeed, they are violent and overweight.</p><p>A photographer, in a thoughtful gesture from Kasbah management, meanders the room and attempts to take compromising snaps of patrons, which he can upload to public Facebook pages in order to guarantee our certain downfall.</p><p>Again, I\u2019m forced to point out, it\u2019s the sort of experience you need only undergo once. I have undergone it more than once, over\u00a0substantially more than one academic year.</p><p>Boredom makes\u00a0its bed and proceeds, with growing blatancy, to recline upon it. You stumble from room to room, finding neither friends nor stimulation. You want a coffee, and maybe an episode of Peep Show.</p><p>Naturally, you end up outside \u2014 with no prospect of re-entry \u2014 an hour-and-a-half before the bus is due to arrive. Inebriation will dull the wait, but a kebab would enliven\u00a0it.</p><p>Kebabs, though blissful \u2014 it turns out \u2014 are expensive,\u00a0lingering and difficult to order without feeling extremely drunk. There\u2019s a choice of three kebab shops and they\u2019re all equally over-lit and all equally filled with angry rugby players.</p><p>Kebab in hand, you have nowhere to sit, so stand awkwardly next to a homeless gentleman. Before too long, he has explained to you, with startling verbosity, why you really ought to give him all your cash, a pack of gum\u00a0and that kebab.</p><p>The bus is still an hour away. You go for a walk and find yourself completely lost. In a moment of utter genius, you give a cab driver\u00a0\u00a33.80 to take you back to Kasbah, which is two minutes away.</p><p>The bus is fifty minutes away. You\u2019re wondering where the nearest place to buy a beer is. It\u2019s Kasbah, and you\u2019ve abandoned her. You\u2019ve dumped her. You didn\u2019t want to commit. The folly of your situation grows conspicuous.</p><p>Stifling tears, you watch the bus emerge from a previously absent mist. Friends spill from kebab shops, from Kasbah and from nearby bushes. A sense of pie-eyed contentment returns to your polluted brain.</p>",

The drinkers, the fortunate folk with free Fridays and the people who don\u2019t possess sufficient\u00a0self-control, have found convenient exit from the increasingly awkward sitch in a lady called Stella and a curious chap called Vino.</p><p>A collectively-minded soul has suggested a drinking game. Reluctantly \u2014 for the soberites wish to remain so and the drunks are perfectly happy as they are \u2014 the conflagration assents. It turns out that Ms Collective-Mind is totally awful at recalling drinking games. <em>The Rest</em> shout and whisper half-remembered terrible games, interspersed with valid suggestions, in her direction and she duly ignores them.</p><p>The question of which game best suits the present company becomes a game in itself. Gamification \u2014 the process of turning anything, quite regardless of its suitability for the purpose, into a game \u2014 becomes, in an unfitting way, <em>the vibe</em>.</p><p>Said vibe is a terrible atmosphere. Indeed, it is neither a vibe nor an atmospheric situation. It\u2019s quite difficult, in fact, to extract one\u2019s consciousness from the brexital uncertainty that floods the room.</p><p>Somehow, as confusion circulates and lays her terrible diversions, a splinter party develops. It need only contain two of the group \u2014 perhaps a mere fifteen per cent of the room \u2014 to dominate the climate. It\u2019s ideology does not become universal and remains unpopular. It\u2019s influence, however, is felt by all.</p><p>Two lads, unbeknownst to the rest, sneak to the front and fire up an xbox (how in god\u2019s name am I meant to capitalise that?). Their game of choice? FIFA. Bloody Fifi (for that is how I refer to the bitch) is always the multiplayer-but-exclusive-to-two game of these situations.\u00a0Before all too long, fragments of one-size-fits-all\u00a0commentary and 32 inches of computer generated grass fill the room.</p><p>Atmosphere \u2014 vibe \u2014 passes from its former earthly low to some subterranean depth scarcely before seen. Guests and patrons drop, rather in the manner of flies. Previously unmentioned \u2014 and undoubtedly fabricated \u2014 nine am seminars are exhibited regretfully\u00a0by friends, desperate to extricate themselves from the faux-sporting non-spectacle in which they are embroiled.</p><p>Everybody wishes to be somewhere else. Under normal circumstances, that would mean that a jolly wander to Spoons, Kelsey\u2019s or Duke ought to be underway.</p><p>Here, however, circs are different.\u00a0Any desire the present company might have once had\u00a0to participate in healthy, human society has mysteriously left. They wish only to depart to their beds to turn a sleepless night populated by\u00a0green fields and \u2018Vardy\u2019s-got-it-he\u2019s-in-with-a-chance-heres\u2019.</p><p>Bluntly, fuck you all, Fifi spinners. Save your sober football fun for sober football crowds and fuck right off.</p><p>That is all I have to say. Sorry if it wasn\u2019t as riveting as you expected.\u00a0FIFA x-teen is a private pleasure. Keep it that way.</p>",

She will join an emerging cohort of female political\u00a0leaders.\u00a0</p><p>For anyone possessing the radical belief that, strangely, women are humans \u2013 equipped with a\u00a0full array of human faculties \u2013 this should be a cause to celebrate. It would appear that, finally, our pre-frontal lobes have outperformed our testosterone\u00a0glands to allow the green shoots of a politics not based on penis-envy power games, but on some rag-tag ideal of meritocracy, to emerge.</p><p>Why then, in our wonderful world of pre-ordained and \u2018post-factual\u2019 opinions, are we not more excited? Probably because the latest great leap forward in female representation at the top level has either come at a time when all available options are thoroughly bad apples, or at our realisation that, as equally capable agents, women are equally capable of being the same vacuous power hungry troglodytes as the men who graced the halls of office before them.</p><p>Let us look then at the playing field, starting at home. Following the UK\u2019s wonderful decision to look inwards from the world and sacrifice future happiness to nurture a heartwarming sturdy feeling of \u2018get \u2019em out of our country\u2019, the job at the top has become free. Vying to replace The Thick of It\u2019s answer to Frank Underwood, David\u00a0Cameron, was a woman so keen to drop the pusillanimous papers defending some inconvenient construct called \u2018human rights\u2019 that one could be forgiven for believing that\u00a0she regularly underdoses on the warm milky formula with which her contacts in the 13th canton of hell supply her in order to maintain the impression that she is a living, breathing, homo sapien. The only obstacle standing in her way was a city extraordinaire, whose CV neatly spells out the time she single-handedly\u00a0averted the 1996 currency crisis, landed a research probe on Mars, and unwound a terrorist plot to kill both The Queen, and the surviving members of Queen. After what we can only imagine to include an exchange promises to the end of a cabinet position, a case of Cabernet Sauvignon, and a cabinet of hunting licenses from one banker husband to another, the latter cleared the way for the former, and we have a brand spanking new prime minister.</p><p>Across the hall, Labour welcomes yet another ex-Oxford\u00a0PPE full-time politician as she lines up a cruel usurpation of what appears to be the first principled party leader since most of the readers were born. Her qualifications include backstabbing, cold-calling, and media malleability; and her hobbies include seeking power, neoliberalism, and the Iraq war.</p><p>North of the wall, and for that matter, in the wild west that is Wales, gender advancements have been manifest in the heady blend of whinging nationalism and heavy handed socialism. For those unacquainted with the events of the 20th century: having a unified and apparently homogenous common enemy, a strong nationalistic sentiment, and socialist governance, are not always the most healthy of mixes.</p><p>Across the Atlantic, the masthead of gender advancement isn\u2019t actual a feminist concerning with tackling the structural disadvantages and pitiful worker\u2019s rights that allow women to make a mere 77 cents to the male dollar (such as Warren and Sanders), but instead the venerable Clinton. Clinton will have the job of facing the renown misogynist and Derridian controversy guru Trump with a band of feminist credentials that extend scarcely further than \u2018being a woman\u2019 \u2013 albeit a white wealthy woman who has been running for the position quite probably for all of her life.</p><p>Sadly, it seems that women in politics can\u2019t all be Aung San Suu Kyi\u00a0or pre-Greece-crisis Merkel, we can\u2019t hope for a grand overhaul of the old order through the liberal feminist route of allowing privileged women to don blazers and succeed to the same degree as privileged men. Because, unfortunately, women have a habit of being just as shit as their male counterparts. For this curmudgeonly rant to not be uselessly destructive \u2013 perhaps it is about time we try and reorganize society so that it isn\u2019t only the dross (to use the other coal mining term, slag, would likely be too inappropriate) and the crud that sifts to the top of the political pile \u2013 but to make some system where neither gender nor virtuosity can impede the realisation of great leadership.</p>",

Henry Seminar and Jean-Jacques Lecture, the eponymous creators of famed old school teaching methods, were both, unfortunately, unavailable for comment, due in part to their non-existence.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>One student also believed that the \u2018monitoring points\u2019 system designed to discourage repeated, unauthorised absence from classes was equally farcical, or \u2018point\u2019-less. \u201cMy mates and I actually made a game out of it\u201d, he remarked.\u00a0 \u201cIt\u2019s pretty straightforward to be honest.

Whether or not this attitude serves our finalists well in the future is, frankly, unknown. Although to be honest, if I was to hazard a guess, I\u2019d say that it won\u2019t. University isn\u2019t just about the grade you get at the end \u2013 it\u2019s about the work ethic you adopt throughout, and the habits you pick up along the way. What habits did these people pick up? How to do the same amount of work as their peers in a shorter space of time? For those already familiar with Einstein\u2019s theory of general relativity, we know that that\u2019s impossible. These people are trying to prove the unprovable \u2013 that E does not equal MC<sup>2</sup>. It\u2019s one thing to break the rules of university by obtaining a degree without doing work. But to break the rules of physics? I asked one physics student whether he thought this was possible. He said no. So, really, you\u2019re all just wasting your time.

With good reason too; their idiosyncratic and sardonic lyrics seem to have captured every emotion on the available spectrum, provided of course that the spectrum starts at disappointment and ends at depression.</p><p>By some accident of history, a great number of Smiths fans have drifted into higher education, wherein most of them have at some point experienced the array of feelings underlying each of their record box gems.

We\u00a0tried hard to find a Warwick angle, struggled, and settled on the unashamedly weak assertion that he\u2019s a bit like Bluebell.</p><hr><p>The Trump Penthouse Foundation announces a major fund raising campaign to support the Foundation\u2019s efforts to have The Trump Penthouse \u2014 the top three floors of 725 Fifth Avenue \u2014 designated a New York City Landmark. Recognition by the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission would confirm the architectural, cultural and historical significance of the site and ensure its existence for future generations.</p><p>For the Trump Penthouse to achieve landmark status it \u201cmust be at least thrity years old, have special historical or aesthetic interest, value, or character as part of the development of the city, state or nation\u201d. The Trump Penthouse meets these criteria in spades.</p><p>The Trump Penthouse designed with elegance and perfection by Angelo Donghia \u2014 the \u2018Saint Laurent of Sofas\u2019 \u2014 was completed in 1983 making it age eligible. The historic component is met by Donald Trump\u2019s persona. He is the first true vulgarian to run for president. Aptly, a place where \u2018Donald Slept Here\u2019 should be preserved for posterity. Aesthetically, with onyx, marble and gold, it is in keeping with the Palace of Versailles, a residence fit for the \u2018Sun King\u2019 Louis XIV of France. As for value and character, The Trump Penthouse mirrors and tracks the decline and fall of American democracy.</p><p>The Foundation expects to enlist the assistance of New York\u2019s Landmarks Preservation Coalition, the conservative cultural vigilante group, in its effort to preserve and maintain the Trump Penthouse. The coalition will field neighborhood organizers to assure full compliance with the Foundation\u2019s financial targets. The coalition is expected to be supported by like-minded alt-right organizations nationwide.</p><p>Kicking off the capital fund drive will be a black tie gala reception honoring the Foundation\u2019s chairman emeritus, Wladziu Valentino Liberace, in recognition for his life-long commitment to faux glitz and glamour on January 20, 2017, Inauguration Day. The event will be hosted by Kim Kardashian and Kanye West at Brooklyn\u2019s historic Grand Prospect Hall with Anna Wintour and the Metropolitan Museum of Art providing the guest list. Admission is set at $50,000 per person, totally and deliciously tax deductible.</p><p>Contributions may be made by cash, check and money order to the address set forth below.

In the eight months prior to the seventieth anniversary of Mercury\u2019s death, they took offence at\u00a0the unexceptional rate of death amongst actors, musicians and public figures and chose to believe that loss of life\u00a0was a phenomenon unique to 2016.</p><p>The deaths of\u00a0David Bowie, Victoria Wood, Alan Rickman, Prince, Paul Daniels, Harper Lee, Terry Wogan, Ronnie Corbett and Nancy Reagan were treated as a personal affront by the death-fearing Earthlings.</p><p>\u201cIn a touching irony,\u201d an all-knowing cultural correspondent said, \u201cit seems highly likely each of those individuals\u00a0would have heartily encouraged fans and followers to forget about the certainty of death, since there\u2019s nothing\u00a0anyone can do to prevent or guarantee it.\u201d</p><p>Speaking at a great gig in the sky, Mr Floyd, unemployed, spoke to the <em>Hoar</em> about his attitude towards death. \u201cAnd I am not frightened of dying, any time will do, I\u00a0don\u2019t mind.

Local students claim that the private investigators are not associated with counter-terrorism special forces, nor with the Warwickshire Police.

During the week beginning 25\u00a0July\u00a02016, the WASH Facebook page published eleven posts, all eleven\u00a0of which had something to do with Islam or apparent Islamism, and only one had anything remotely to do with the society by mentioning secularism.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d never have thought of it in that way at all,\u201d said Michael Savage, 43, from Rugby, just one of the many followers of the WASH Facebook page who are completely unaffiliated with the University of Warwick, \u201cbut the more I think about it, the more I\u2019m convinced that it\u2019s the only explanation for such an unhealthy obsession with sharing Islam related content.

If they truly support us, verily, we are pleased. If they do not, we remain pleased. For they have done the fantastic job of enforcing the \u201cus versus them\u201d mentality [which] we work so hard to perpetuate. This page has either engaged them [young British Muslims] in our movement, or has disenfranchised them, and this is exactly what we want so they have directly helped our cause.

We have a great many beds. They are deposited in secret locations about the university in order to facilitate mass sleepovers in lecture theatres at short notice. Our beds sit amongst our proudest assets.</p><p>Our unfortunate shortage, you see, is not of beds but of bedrooms.

Instead, consider that there are a number of ongoing projects that aim to resolve the problem.</p><p>We have made an especial effort to employ anti-social, defeated individuals to posts in the residential life team. This measure, we have found, has greatly increased the first year dropout rate, and has thus reduces pressure on rooms by the second term of each year.</p><p>Recently, we have started to experiment with the placement of beds. Perhaps shockingly, it seems that a bed may be placed on practically any flat surface of sufficient size.</p><p>Consequently, this year\u2019s freshers may find themselves in receipt of a grave honour.

She peels open the spittle-sealed brown envelope containing the arrangement of letters that determine in which middling sized town north of London she will endure the following three years of her life.

Yet it became apparent that Sophie\u2019s promised offer to read mathematics in amongst the ubiquitous grey of Warwick University is an unhappy medium.

Be they left, right, progressive or regressive;\n                  this paper aims to include all excluded ideas in daily campus\n                  exchanges.\n                </p>\n                <p>\n                  So if you take offence, good. Half of the content in here\n                  offends us too. But offence is truly a healthy feeling \u2014 it\n                  allows us to challenge views we would otherwise hold\n                  unchallenged. It allows us to measure our views against those\n                  that oppose them, to make them clearer in a critical light. If\n                  we surmount this challenge, our foundations for these feelings\n                  are fortified, and if we do not \u2014 then these beliefs are but\n                  dead dogma that we should not pride ourselves in holding. As\n                  such, frequently we should ask ourselves the age-old challenge\n                  of introspection: what would we say to the flat-earthers, the\n                  moon landing truthers, the dinosaur deniers? How solid are our\n                  first principles?\n                </p>\n                <p>\n                  Indeed we ask you to hold in question any agents or\n                  authorities that tell you which ideas are too odious, too\n                  influential, and too dangerous for your ill developed\n                  rationality to handle. For it is discourse closing\n                  non-platforming powers that have iteratively caused\n                  populations to sleepwalk blindly into a banal milieu of evil.\n                  Such actions are all the more insidious if <em>we</em> consent\n                  to the cutting of ideas from the picture \u2014 we are choosing to\n                  blinker ourselves! All the more pertinent in the sheltered\n                  environment of a university; if we are not armed with the\n                  critical faculties to personally protect our cherished ideas,\n                  how do we expect them to self-sustain in the great wide world?\n                  Where one and all do not necessarily share the same base\n                  ideas? As Hitchens before implored; should any prying power\n                  tell you what you are too easily manipulated to cope with;\n                  tell them to pick a number, get in line, and kiss your arse.\n                </p>\n                <p>\n                  Hence in this paper you will find not a manifesto but a\n                  platform. A table on which to place, pillage, adopt and\n                  discard ideas. You will find as many views as there are\n                  articles, the emphasis for the writers has been to adopt the\n                  mentality of one holding the positions of their articles,\n                  whether they subscribe to them or not. The articles are\n                  scarcely edited; we are not looking to create a conformist\n                  push. If in them you find gaping holes, then good: write them\n                  down, form a retort, deploy it when needed. For only then will\n                  this paper have achieved its aims.\n                </p>\n                <p>\n                  You also will not find a closed circuit. Short of inciting\n                  violence, we aim with our writers to be sufficiently\n                  commodious as to hold all peripheral positions no matter their\n                  perceived moral worth.\n                </p>\n                <p>\n                  You won\u2019t find a body that opposes student politics, though at\n                  times it may appear so. Instead the aim is quite the opposite\n                  \u2014 we hold that the protection provided by a campus setting\n                  should allow a student body to act as a watchdog weighing on\n                  the boundaries of society. Before we each enter the world\n                  where words have costs, we can shape our ideas in an insulated\n                  environment. Yet this requires vigorous challenge and debate\n                  to be efficacious. Not the airy exchange of pre-approved\n                  positions but a genuine creative field of argument. That is\n                  what we aim to provide.\n                </p>\n                <p>\n                  Finally, at no point do we wish to make direct attacks \u2014 not\n                  that there aren\u2019t juicy examples to target \u2014 but because it\n                  isn\u2019t in our interest to hate and berate but rather punish a\n                  pernicious attitude that is percolating into student\n                  discourse, namely the ostracising of disquieting outsider\n                  ideas.\n                </p>\n                <p>\n                  What instead you will find is an imperative to think for\n                  yourself. A chance to challenge and be challenged in a place\n                  where positions aren\u2019t pre-emptively prohibited, where you can\n                  trade ideas; not abuse. Where writers won\u2019t be pushed out or\n                  shouted down in the fear that they\u2019ll frighten a cushioned\n                  audience.\n                </p>\n                <p>\n                  And if you find such introspection disagreeable then we ask\n                  why it is you fear that your views won\u2019t hold up to scrutiny.\n                </p>\n                <p>Yours liberally,</p>\n                <p>C.

As the goose came closer, tea and coffee drinkers of the Humanities Caf\u00e9 began banging on the glass to try and warn Tim of the approaching \u2018devil bird\u2019. Cries were also heard first year psychology mentor Karren Karrensbee who proceeded to shout encouraging messages to Tim such as \u201cIt\u2019s okay mentor\u2019s here!\u201d and \u201cYou were probably only going to get a 2:2 anyway\u201d.</p><p>In a climactic moment, the humanities goose was seen to lurch forwards and began flapping its wings towards Tim in what has been identified as a sadistic ritual before a goose attacks its prey. It was at this point snipers on the south-facing roof were ordered to take out the goose \u201cbefore things got messy\u201d.</p><p>The backlash to this event has been huge. We now understand that the goose involved in the incident was none other than Instagram favourite and local hero: Graham the Goose. Many tributes have been paid to Graham on social media by important figures such as ex-vice chancellor Nigel Thrift: \u201cR.I.P big G, you will be sorely missed #legend\u201d and Warwick maintenance worker Howard Dustman \u201cHeart of gold that little guy, wouldn\u2019t ever catch him as a character on angry birds would you? #geeseforlife\u201d.</p><p></p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1891\" src=\"https://thehoar.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/iskyh.png\" alt=\"iskyh\" width=\"470\" height=\"215\" srcset=\"https://thehoar.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/iskyh.png 470w,https://thehoar.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/iskyh-300x137.png 300w,https://thehoar.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/iskyh-192x88.png 192w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 470px) 100vw, 470px\"><p>Behavioural zoologist, Dr Spleinburger, has condemned the actions of campus snipers on Reddit, vouching that Graham was clearly trying to cool Tim down because he looked hot.</p><p>Finally, Warwick Goose Society President \u2014 Ashley Pondsford \u2014 has labelled the incident a \u2018sickening attack\u2019 and has linked the death to yet another attempt by overseas students to wipe out the campus geese forever.

Prisons.</strong></p><p>Obviously at the top of the list, this stroke of social policy genius is just one example of how the NUS are really at the cutting edge of political thought.</p><p><strong>2. Gay men\u2019s reps in LGBT societies.</strong></p><p>Everyone knows that gay men have it far too easy nowadays, what with all the new anti-discrimination and marriage equality laws being passed, and so the NUS quite rightly decided to cast them out.</p><p><strong>3. That weird guy from your halls, you know the one.</strong></p><p>You know, that one who never talks when he\u2019s in the kitchen, who\u2019s always shouting at his Xbox, who you are sure has been in your room when you were out and stolen some of your underwear? Well worry no more; he\u2019s out of there.</p><p><strong>4. Human sacrifices to the Dark Lord Lucifer.</strong></p><p>Okay, we\u2019re not so sure that we agree with this one, but from now on it will be frowned upon to make human sacrifices to our lord and master Beelzebub in the SU of any university still affiliated with the NUS. But on the bright side, goats are still fair game.</p><p><strong>5. Lincoln University, Newcastle University, among others.\u00a0</strong></p><p>After universities across the country left the NUS, our glorious leaders have decided the only appropriate way to deal with these schisms is to just pretend that they don\u2019t exist. Good on them.</p><p><strong>6. Any remaining shred of credibility.</strong></p><p>The NUS, being so attuned to the hearts and minds of students, have decided that the best way to represent its members is to present itself as the country as a whole sees students; a mob of selfish, lazy children. Whoever said the NUS is not representative?</p><p><strong>8. The number 7.</strong></p><p>According to the Bible, God created the world in seven days. Therefore, as we can all agree, the NUS have decided that this number is a relic of a single-faith society, and its inclusion in our counting system is oppressive to us all.</p><p><strong>9. Platforms of any kind.</strong></p><p>Not content at keeping their no-platforming policy to racist or radical speakers, the NUS have decided to remove every kind of platform, including, but not limited to, platform shoes, platform games and the 10m platform.</p><p><strong>10. Anti-Semitism.</strong></p><p>Malia Bouattia has repeatedly been accused of anti-semitism, and, as the head of the NUS, she cannot be seen to be bigoted in any way. The solution? Declare that anti-semitism does not exist. Bravo.</p>",

My dear wife, Honoria, grunted meaningfully at me over her shotgun.\u00a0On raising my head, I found her pointing maniacally at\u00a0the\u00a0March 1902 issue\u00a0of <em>Lots-of-Expensive-Booze Monthly</em>.</p><p>Reading that volume the previous evening, I had inadvertently passed out in a pool of my own vomit, leaving the publication partially submerged but open. Honoria \u2014 for she is an extremely intelligent woman \u2014 was\u00a0greatly excited to\u00a0discover a black and white image that depicted\u00a0an asymmetrical decanter filled with a green liquid on the exposed leaf of the\u00a0periodical.</p><p>I bolted from my Chesterfield to the bureau where the journal\u00a0lay, unsettling a Queen Anne armoire en route, and read the article with\u00a0uncharacteristic eagerness. In doing so, I learned all that I have recounted thus far.</p><p>A mere six months later \u2014 for these were the golden days of British railways, when no two towns of this\u00a0sceptre\u2019d isle were more than two years separated\u00a0by rail \u2014 I emerged into the thick industrial\u00a0fog of Royal Leamington Spa. I remember being\u00a0shocked at how much less thick the thick industrial fog\u00a0here was\u00a0than\u00a0the thick industrial fog at my home in the\u00a0metropolis.</p><p>A passing vagrant informed me that the renowned\u00a0eccentric public house was but a short walk away. Pleased, I rewarded him with two guinea pigs and a blowjob.</p><p>I enjoyed the walk. Only thrice did\u00a0brigands succeed in\u00a0looting me of my every possession, so I was not disheartened on arrival at\u00a0the allegorical\u00a0establishment, merely weary.</p><p>Contained within a tall building of Georgian sensibilities, the eccentric public house called herself Kelsey\u2019s. Her doormen wore a dark uniform.\u00a0From their accents, their demeanour and the dainty turn of their ankles, I would gladly\u00a0wager that they were Poles.</p><p>I made myself comfortable inside the eccentric old girl, and waited impatiently for something to lubricate my throat. After perhaps four minutes and sixty-three seconds, a\u00a0fine creature in Topshop pumps and a ski jacket\u00a0delivered me a vessel of the green\u00a0honeydew.\u00a0Giddy with excitement and opiates, I was almost so ungentlemanly\u00a0as to thank her.</p><p>I poured a quart into the lead crystal tumbler that I carry in my upper-left-inner-lower-right breast pocket as a point of habit. Lifting the\u00a0chalice to my lips, I inhaled deeply. The liquid had the nose of an Afghan dancing girl, but the odour of a kiwi fruit. It\u00a0flowed smoothly down my throat, evoking memories of other occasions upon which I had drunk from a glass.</p><p>The\u00a0taste compares unfavourable to that of fermented goat faeces, a drink in which I overindulged whilst travelling Mongolia with Barry Manilow in the 1870s. Regrettably, I remember little else of the fabled drink, for my evening became clouded by busy, yet incomprehensible, conversation.</p>",

I have done incredible things I didn\u2019t think I could do. I\u2019m very happy. It\u2019s because I didn\u2019t know how important I am.<br>\nI am very important. I do things that I know are hard and then people say I do them well out of politeness and I smile. I do things very well. All things. I\u2019m actually very good. A lot of people say so.</p><p>\u201cWhen I\u2019m more important than you, I\u2019ll probably remember you all as my little people. You\u2019re only small, but you\u2019ve been very supportive. We\u2019ve had some mad nights. We\u2019ve had some really mad nights. Haha. Tequila. I don\u2019t drink tequila because I don\u2019t like it. But people say \u2018tequila\u2019 when they are getting drunk on a mad one.\u201d</p><p>She continued, \u201cI feel privileged to have accepted your support. You\u2019re ok. You know, hardly equivalent to me, but you\u2019re acceptable. I\u2019ve honestly never been happier than I am right now. It\u2019s so sad. I\u2019m really happy.</p><p>\u201cI think my legacy is important. I\u2019m scared my legacy might not be as incredible as I have been. I know it will be though. People said so. People won\u2019t forget me because I am so much better than them.</p><p>When I have an opinion, it\u2019s actually a fact. If you think about it, it\u2019s just completely true. That\u2019s because I have excellent judgement. People have told me that too.</p><p>This is really sad. I\u2019m so happy. I\u2019m feeling so many things. I\u2019m so proud of my people. So happy. It\u2019s been really hard. So sad.</p><p>Thank you for acknowledging that I\u2019m outstanding.\u201d</p><p>When asked what she had won to deserve such recognition, a well-dressed editor leaned in and whispered: \u201cfuck all\u201d.</p>",

Cite your own words.</h3><p>Only ever citing your own blog in submitted work enforces your confidence in your understanding of the degree subject; confidence that tutors will at first resist but soon applaud.</p><h3>8. Arrange to talk to your head of department but instead throw sandwiches at his door.</h3><p>Making sure you do this at the time of the proposed meeting will fully drive home the point.</p><h3>9. Go interdisciplinary.</h3><p>Attend examinations for different subjects, writing out the revised material for your area of study for each paper. Do not attend the examination for the revised module itself.</p><h3>10. Deny having ever attended the University of Warwick.</h3><p>Refuse a final grade when it is given to you, claiming to both faculty and your family that you were working as a beautician in Coventry for the last three years.</p>",

    "body": "<p>Sadly, terms end. This one ends quite soon, but despair ye not. Here are thirteen ways to make yourself feel quite at home when you\u2019re, er, back home.</p><h4>1. Pop</h4><p>Mix blackcurrant cordial with vomit, and carefully brush the mixture onto your bathroom floor. Switch off the lights and force\u00a0a man in a wig\u00a0to play Cotton Eye Joe loudly and on repeat. For added effect, have sex with a family pet afterwards.</p><h4>2. Library</h4><p>Board a cross-channel ferry at peak time, so that there are not enough seats, and in a heat wave, so that your clothes stick to you. Purchase an extremely expensive meal from a woman who may or may not\u00a0base her personality on that of a\u00a0particular German chancellor from the late 1930s. Walk up and down the stairs. Marvel at the shitness of any person\u00a0who leaves books on an absent desk for more than half an hour. Consider suicide.</p><h4>3. Rootes Grocery Store</h4><p>Enter Tesco. Fill a basket with things that you do not require. Move near to the self checkout. Stand still for fifteen minutes. Go to the self checkout. Find a deeply unhappy shift worker and ask him or her to mumble a number. \u201c\u00a37.89\u201d. Leave Tesco. In order to replicate RGS pricing, dump\u00a0most of your purchases in a litter bin.</p><h4>4. The road crossing outside\u00a0Rootes Grocery Store</h4><p>Locate a busy section of road and an opaque scarf. Tie the scarf over your eyes and walk into the road.</p><h4>5. Arts Centre</h4><p>Choose a useful corridor in your place of residence. A shortcut, perhaps, which shelters you from the rain on your passage to the lavatory.\u00a0Line it with posters for concerts, exhibitions and comedians. Drink two bottles of wine. Walk through it the next morning and consider, regretfully, how uncultured you are.</p><h4>6. Smack</h4><p>Invite forty people to come and stand in your shower. Write naughty words like \u2018cunt\u2019 on the walls in order to make you feel more grown up.\u00a0Racially segregate the upstairs shower from\u00a0the downstairs shower.</p><h4>7. Kasbah</h4><p>Get drunk. Get on a dubious bus to a down-at-heel regional club. Miss the return bus. Find a cosy spot on a building site and curl up for a sleep.</p><h4>8. Switch</h4><p>Eat seven packets of paracetamol and stare\u00a0into the beam of a laser pointer whilst listening to\u00a0the washing machine.</p><h4>9. Xananas</h4><p>Consider a\u00a0part of your\u00a0family home that you have never explored, like the area behind the door in the bedroom of the sibling you don\u2019t like very much. Name it Xajazaxa and never venture there.</p><h4>10. Piazza Steps</h4><p>Carry a bag of empty cava bottles to a pedestrianised shopping area in your nearest town. Spread them carelessly. Sit on a piece of concrete and watch a sport, in which you have limited interest, on your phone whilst you pretend to be a hardened smoker.</p><h4>11. Kelsey\u2019s</h4><p>Spend six weeks drinking an indiscriminate mixture of Lambrini, Red Bull and orange juice in your attic.</p><h4>12. Royal Leamington Spa</h4><p>Draw a picture of a beast, composed of the top half of\u00a0Joanna Lumley and the bottom half of a street-dwelling crack-smoker who\u2019s missing one foot.</p><h4>13. Circling</h4><p>Sit at a\u00a0kitchen table and pour Ribena onto your face.</p>",

He claimed the lack of purpose didn\u2019t bother him; \u201cthink of all the money I can make, which I can spend on making more money. It\u2019s as if university was just the little shit bit before I can enjoy 50 years behind a desk. I don\u2019t have to think ever again, it\u2019s great\u201d.

Remember as you\u2019re a student you can register at two different addresses. Watch with interest as the website implodes when you go through the rigmarole again with a second address. Sort through your Hotmail as the server sends you upwards of twelve emails about how you\u2019ve registered to vote in one address, now the other address, but you\u2019re not on the list that sends you loads of shit from third parties, but you can get a postal vote, but you\u2019ve also registered in two places, is this right?, do you want a postal vote? Delete accordingly.</p><p>Await your Warwickshire County Council polling card patiently. Receive a call from your mum that your home county polling card has arrived. Get to the weekend of 18 June. Give up. Utilise our reliable midlands train network to make the long journey home to vote in your home constituency.</p><h3>2. Remember who we\u2019re voting for.</h3><p>The referendum is a big decision for the United Kingdom and not one to be taken lightly. Much like the obligatory Sunday small talk over a series of cups of tea, it is also necessary to consider the needs of the older generation. We smile awkwardly through their sweeping racist and homophobic statements and so too is it advisable to grin and bear their political opinions. Consider the future for the elderly when you get to the polling station on Thursday. They won\u2019t be around forever, let\u2019s make their last decade or two their happiest.</p><h3>3. Know what Brexit is.</h3><p>You\u2019ve seen the headlines and heard what Brexit is up to. \u201cBrexit concerns Germany\u201d, \u201cBrexit will permanently lower UK incomes\u201d\u2026 Contrary to popular belief, Brexit is not an MP and close friend of Farage but a portmanteau\u00a0(see: \u2018Brangelina\u2019).</p><h3>4. We need to look after Greece.</h3><p>If it weren\u2019t for Greece we wouldn\u2019t have lost our virginity, phone and dignity on that blinding piss cheap holiday to Ooh Ahh Malia. (Is this right? \u2014 Ed) These poor people have put up with our finest student behaviour, best exhibited in Smack, and frankly any contribution we can make to help them out is to be encouraged. They really don\u2019t have their shit together but they have cracking food, music and patience for us. Do your good deed this week and vote Remain in the name of the Greeks.</p><h3>5. There\u2019s a 2:1 in it.</h3><p>You heard it right. Thrift\u00a0the Second\u00a0has promised at least a 2:1 should the population of Warwick\u2019s campus vote at least 80% in favour of the Remain campaign. Speculation continues as to whether the new vice chancellor is pro-EU or simply trying to elevate his status from unknown to meme-worthy.</p><hr><p><small>Main image <a href=\"https://twitter.com/warwickuni/status/596269567908929538\">borrowed</a> from the official Warwick Twitter account.</small></p>",

    "body": "<p>Escaping from the chilling haze of the Leamington morning into the cloying warmth of <i>The Jet</i>, the mood is far from festive. \u201cPunters aren\u2019t going to be happy\u201d Landlady Jena Fobe bemoans, \u201cbut the kid\u2019s got a point\u2026 give me a hand with this bunting will you?\u201d.</p><p>Throughout the town, similar such preparations for pseudo-sovereignty clambering parties have had to be begrudgingly withheld, as the UK, and the world, come to terms with mere 456 words spilled out onto social media by Ivor Nydia, a first-year Warwick\u00a0psychology student.</p><blockquote><p>Brexit activist and part-time soft racist Gary Getemowt, was stunned by this revelation.</p></blockquote><p>Remarkable for both its brevity and its incision, Ivor first cuts through the smokescreen surrounding clarity of thought ahead of the referendum. \u201cI\u2019ve been doing some thinking, the decision was not obvious to begin with\u201d, Ivor informs us, \u201cbut I eventually realised\u00a0that this debate was not about whether we approved of the union exactly how it is or not, rather it\u2019s what we want our country, our futures, and our pay-packet to look like\u201d. From here on, Ivor takes an ingenious\u00a0step in realising that all arguments to leave are, in their totality, arguments for xenophobia, racism, and Marxist-Leninism \u2013 all of which Ivor has the cutting reflex for social justice to avoid.\u00a0Brexit activist and part-time soft racist Gary Getemowt, was stunned by this revelation; \u201cshit\u201d, he noted, \u201che\u2019s got me there, better vote Remain to keep my cover\u201d.\u00a0</p><blockquote><p>\u201cuntil reading [Ivor\u2019s] post, I actually thought the European Union <i>was </i>perfect.\u201d</p></blockquote><p>\u00a0</p><p>Simply spelling out what the problem is wasn\u2019t quite enough to make the voting stations pack up early. For that, we can see the pragmatic jargon-cutting balance exercised by Ivor in his diagnosis of the nation\u2019s European ailment. \u201cThe European union <i>isn\u2019t </i>perfect\u201d, he elucidates, \u201cany institution that can facilitate TTIP, fail to protect Crimea, allow thousands of refugees to drown, and appoint as head of an unelected commission the man responsible for hiding the most money from public coffers in the world; is an institution that needs serious reform\u201d. He even provided references to what were previously considered nutty \u2018Lexit\u2019 articles as proof.</p><p>This insight was a stunning reality slap to Remain campaigner Welthia Whitgirl, who in wide-eyed amazement assured us that \u201cuntil reading [Ivor\u2019s] post, I actually thought the European Union <i>was </i>perfect, for a short while I was at a loss for who to support, I felt like an Aztec gazing at the heart being ripped from a human sacrifice and thinking, <i>maybe an alternative is possible</i>\u201c.</p><p>Yet rather than take the weak minded moralistic get-out pill, Ivor brought the whole debate crashing down into a simple utility equation. By noting that the benefits: cheap travel, heightened privatisation, increased international competition, French women, French wine, Erasmus, peace, environmental\u00a0buzzwords, short-term favourable macroeconomic forecasts, Italian women, Italian wine, and so on \u2013 cumulatively outweigh the costs, Ivor reached a startling conclusion: \u201cConsequentially, we\u2019d be better off reforming the EU, and not taking a plunge into the unknown\u201d.</p><blockquote><p>On hearing the news, Farage announced that \u201cthere\u2019s not really any point going through with this whole thing now\u201d.</p></blockquote><p>Far from fall favourlessly into deaf ears, Ivor\u2019s post was met with unanimous approval. At worst, some Brexiteers were irate for having wasted their time squeezing the annuls of their cloying porgy-esque unBritainaphobic ideological wish-wash for nothing.</p><p>On hearing the news, Farage announced that \u201cthere\u2019s not really any point going through with this whole thing now\u201d, and polling station workers have started preemptively packing up their lots and preparing for a free afternoon to enjoy the phlegmatic overcast English weather.</p><p>Elsewhere, the phone hasn\u2019t stopped ringing for Ivor, who has had to bat away promises of posts at a plethora of acronym heavy institutions. Far too busy to comment on the developments to a minnow e-mag such as <i>The Hoar,</i>\u00a0a spokesperson released a statement ensuring us that the UN will have to seek an interim replacement director when Ban Ki-moon steps down later this year, so as to warm up the seat for when Ivor finished the next two \u2018mad years\u2019 at Warwick University.</p><p>Indeed, the only popular body available for comment was ITV, who we are told are in talks with Boris Johnson, in order to secure a long career in Reality TV.</p>",

Probably just looking for a back-up as his degree doesn\u2019t seem to be working out, the poor bugger puts in more hours than you\u2019d think were necessary and he still comes out in the shit.

That and having a total lack of personality means that I haven\u2019t been accepted for any internships means I\u2019m buggered come the end of my degree. This made me realise that I\u2019ll need something really impressive to add to my CV in place of a decent degree classification. I\u2019m really good with people and will fight for the rights of my peers.\u201d</p><blockquote><p>\u201cYou try walking around campus for 8 hours supporting some wet-behind-the-ears mummy\u2019s boy. It\u2019s all going to end in tears.\u201d</p></blockquote><p>Course mate Kate Stewart made her own predictions \u201cI mean, we\u2019re talking about a guy who didn\u2019t know how to cook pasta less than three years ago and is utterly useless as a person. Would you trust him as an SU officer? Now I\u2019ll have to pretend to support him and wear one of his stupid customised shirts walking around campus annoying freshers and people in lectures. THEN I\u2019ll have to go on suicide watch once they lose and realise they haven\u2019t done any work for the last 6 months. A pain in the arse, it really is. You know how cold it is at that time of year? You try walking around campus for 8 hours supporting some wet-behind-the-ears mummy\u2019s boy. It\u2019s all going to end in tears.\u201d</p><p>Frank finally said \u201cI\u2019ve got a really good feeling about this; I can tell it\u2019s going to work out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just hope he doesn\u2019t use a bloody Superman S for his campaign, there\u2019s nothing super about him.\u201d</p>",

This was despite Rashford not once being seen strolling around campus in his Bank of America Merrill Lynch tracksuit narcissistically.</p><p>Pundits are struggling to account for the decision with everyone on campus being well aware of just how important the footballers are. The Firsts, after all, heroically overcame the likes of Derby University 1s and Loughborough University 3s, but the courageous and hard-fought 3-0 loss to bitter rivals Coventry at this year\u2019s Varsity is thought to have been a factor against our warriors.</p><p>First team striker and self-confessed \u2018top lad\u2019 Christiano Ronaldinho (born Barry Smith) remained optimistic despite being snubbed: \u201cI\u2019m actually happy not to make the squad. It would have meant that I would have had to miss the last three Pops, which is the last opportunity I\u2019ll ever have to score as many girls as goals I\u2019ve scored this season simply because of the club tie I\u2019m wearing.\u201d</p><p>He continued, \u201cEven when I was 9 and on Barnsley\u2019s books for half a season, I knew I wanted to get my degree in Comparative American Studies, first and foremost, so it\u2019s a relief not to have to turn the place down.</p><p>\u201cThis also means I can keep wearing my football tracksuit, I haven\u2019t taken it off once in the past three years. Even when I went for a job interview at KPMG. I didn\u2019t get the job but how else was I meant to show everyone how big a deal I was?\u201d the goalscoring hero concluded positively.</p><p>When asked why he overlooked the Warwick stars, England manager Roy Hodgson said, \u201cWowick who?\u201d. He clearly hasn\u2019t been to campus and seen our champions.</p>",
