    <h4>What is this?</h4>
    <p>
      Itâ€™s a static archive of the Hoar website from the mid-twenty-teens (i.e.
      2016 to 2017).
    </p>

    <h4>Static?</h4>
    <p>
      The original Hoar site involved a long-running server that cost a lot to
      run. When we shut down, we took a snapshot of the site and replaced the
      server with a folder of HTML files connected to the internet. More
      recently, browsers changed and our snapshot stopped working so well. We
      wrote a script to fix it, and belatedly noticed that part of what that
      script did was to extract all the content from the site and as structured
      data, so configured a trendy static site generator to turn that data into
      a proper static site.
