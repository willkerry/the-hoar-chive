      <p>
        In Warwick, everything passes, nothing changes. As such, in a year of
        existence, the Hoar captured all that it wished to say in this narrow,
        grey, corporate affair of a university. Should you ever find yourself
        resenting this mechanistic campus of grating self-interest in the West
        Midlands — open a bottle of red and find your grievance here in this
        book.
      </p>

      <p>It’s been a pleasure Hoaring ourselves out for you,</p>

      <p>With love,</p>

      <p>Theodora x</p>
