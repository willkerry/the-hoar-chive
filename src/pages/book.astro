      This is the end, darling readers.
    </p>

    <p>
      In Warwick, everything passes, nothing changes. As such, in a year of
      existence, the Hoar captured all that it wished to say in this narrow,
      grey, corporate affair of a university. Should you ever find yourself
      resenting this mechanistic campus of grating self-interest in the West
      Midlands — open a bottle of red and find your grievance here in this book.
    </p>

    <p>It’s been a pleasure Hoaring ourselves out for you,</p>

    <p>With love,</p>

    <p>Theodora x</p>
